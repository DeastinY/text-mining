########### Rosecrance ###########
I'll be the one to reload it when there's no bodies left for you 
 I won't be the one to condone it when I know that your time is through 
 So don't you blink an eye 'cause that's all it's gonna take 
 March yourself into the end and praise it every step of the way 
 March yourself into the end 
 I will find you 
 Open my eyes, I have been blind 
 I'll be the one to reload it just for you
########### Brace Legs ###########
So distinct and out of reach 
 Now we're laying awake 
 We can't stop it now 
 Don't beg for mercy 
 Fight, we never stop 
 March onto your death and bring your glory back 
 Your blood will be shed 
 Love we're willing to take 
 Its all a mistake 
 Tell me fate, take it away 
 It will never end and we have just begun 
 Victory and glory 
 Give it up, we never stop
########### Bow Down ###########
Fucking bow down 
 You were the price of the killing while we were waiting on the other side 
 The other ones were just standing out but we were playing on the other side 
 You can close your eyes 
 Forget what you have seen 
 Bless us all 
 They are guilty 
 Bring back what is yours 
 We tried to escape but you still waste 
 Waste away 
 Nothing remains 
 Nothing is safe 
 No mistakes 
 You can't take away what you've given away 
 You were the price of the killing 
 We were just playing
########### Empires Erased ###########
This isn't over yet and we've only just begun to create this 
 I thought I lost it all 
 Not wrapped between the sheets 
 Trust in me, you will see 
 Believe in me and let the others have their way with you 
 Your life forgotten, empires erased 
 Trust in me, you will see this victory 
 We stop defeat, this offering it must remain 
 Catastrophe in this city, on this day catastrophe 
 It's not over yet 
 There's something left for the taking 
 Forces of nature ruler and judge when the heaves open up 
 Give me a reaction 
 Give it all up 
 This is the only way we can obey 
 This is something that we will never win 
 Hope for defeat
########### Open Arms To Damnation ###########
Day by day, let's pave the path to escape 
 Pave the tragic endings passed away 
 Bring forth sincerity, bring forth the change 
 This portrait of dishonesty will be slain 
 I will not hold back 
 I will not regret 
 I won't hold back 
 I won't regret 
 This place I now call home is nothing more than a fallacy 
 Nothing more than a fallacy 
 This is not my home 
 You've got a one way ticket to hell with open arms to damnation
########### Abstract Art ###########
Oh, great shapes 
 You deserve this torture 
 Oh, great shapres 
 You deserve this 
 End this conversation 
 You've been so frustrated 
 Get on the floor 
 Torn and beaten, your lifes lies in my hands 
 A life once wasted 
 Nothing to bring it back 
 You and I withstand broken visions 
 Search and destroy and we don't even give a fuck 
 This is over with 
 Your life lies in my hands 
 Fade away, don't be afraid
########### The New Reign ###########
I can't take this 
 Giver to the waves 
 I have come to destroy 
 I will lift this inhibition and we dawn the new day 
 This is a shame calling this name out of reach 
 Out of mind 
 And with nothing left to gain, we overcome the mundane 
 And with nothing left to gain, a new reason to live 
 And with nothing to gain, we are the new reign 
 Sacrifice your own inspirations 
 The price tags on temptations
########### The Takeover ###########
Welcome to America 
 Take a seat and a number 
 Count down and don't you dare stand up cause you might just make a difference 
 The city is paved without any shame and leaving your faith has become standard grade 
 Live with your falsehoods 
 Everyone is staring 
 Everyone is watching 
 This is not reality 
 Decide on where your soul should be 
 This endless trap of treachery
########### Elimination ###########
There has to be something worth fighting for 
 Is there anything to convince me? 
 Im trapped in society 
 Looking to find the fucking exit 
 At the mercy of mankind 
 Bring me knowledge 
 Give me strength 
 The decision has already been conformed 
 Now we separate the relations 
 Masked from the world 
 I'm ready for this 
 Let's take control 
 Now incite together in a connected environment 
 Draining the shit we deal with everyday 
 If it's support you're after then try to see me in a different way 
 Let your eyes see the truth in me 
 The difference drives us even further away 
 Let your eyes see truth - try to see me in a different way 
 Let your eyes see truth - now to conquer the raising threat 
 Of existing in tension and strain were in 
 I declare when the dangers upon us 
 I will destroy every aspect of it
########### The Accountable ###########
It all crumbles beneath me 
 I can take the time to be here 
 I can take the kill 
 I walk back and forth 
 You're stuck between the walls 
 I will come forth 
 I try to reason but I'm still there 
 It is the other side of your words? 
 Where the meaning don't relate 
 So we compensate 
 The other side of my mind 
 Tries to make its way inside 
 My conscience won't be with me tonight 
 Thought I could see the light and you could see it too 
 Does this make me horrible? 
 My judgment fails to be the truth 
 Now with open ground at my feet 
 I conquer all the things detaining me 
 Habits fracture and try to drain 
 The wretched guilt that dwells in me 
 Try to justify yourself 
 It's your mistake - be accountable 
 Why do you blame the people around you?
########### Now Arise ###########
Time is coming to an end 
 Prepare for the worst to come 
 You arise but your life has run dry 
 Show me the answers I’ve been looking for 
 Where did they come from? 
 I never wanted it to be like this 
 Lose what you have in mind 
 You all will be taken away 
 Nothing seems real anymore 
 I am no stranger to hatred and lies 
 We’re lost and there’s nothing left 
 Fear is the only thing that keeps us alive 
 Lose what you have in mind 
 What keeps us alive 
 You all will be taken away 
 Burn this place so we can celebrate 
 A start of a brand new day 
 New beginnings, time for change 
 New beginnings, time for change 
 Don’t always hide the fury and sit in silence 
 The less I hear, the more I’m scared 
 Feel the victory and jump into a sea of serenity 
 Let the water clean your dreams 
 Afraid to let go of everything 
 Trying to keep unity and make a statement 
 But you bleed, your head is spilling 
 All the judgments 
 All the wars 
 All the rivalry we face 
 Is leaking on the floor 
 When will it be okay to come outside 
 When the storm is dying and the rain is done 
 The composure of my soul is harmonized 
 By the sounds that travel into me 
 Show me the answers I’ve been looking for 
 Where did they come from? 
 Nothing seems real anymore 
 I am no stranger to all of this bullshit 
 Time is coming to an end 
 Prepare for the worst try to keep unity 
 Make a statement, but you bleed, your head is spilling 
 All the wars 
 All the rivalries 
 The composure of my soul is harmonized 
 By the sounds that travel into me
########### Live Like I'm Real ###########
Echoes of your voice filling up the hallways. 
 I still walk here and you still don't disappear. 
 Disappear (No hesitation). 
 I will move on (It's been over done). 
 Enough of everything. 
 It's been too long. 
 Erase the facts, erase the fucking past 
 This is the back of the front door. 
 And I control you. 
 And I still walk here. 
 And as a matter of timing crumbles. 
 And leaves us alone again with the wreckage. 
 It still smolders here. 
 Erase the facts, erase the fucking past. 
 Enough of everything. 
 It's been too long no looking back. 
 I'll be alive, live like I'm real. 
 Disappear now. 
 I will move on. 
 I'm hoping it's tonight when I can turn out these lights, 
 and be alive.
########### Starved ###########
To starve and see all around us. 
 The feast is ready to serve. 
 Now enjoy the taste of reality. 
 Seasons of change. 
 How will you be replaced? 
 This isn't as easy as you think. 
 Get on your knees. 
 It's hard to see the truth in all of your lies. 
 It's a memory to me. 
 It's not gonna take any longer. 
 Get ready to move along. 
 The movement on. 
 This is your deficiency. 
 I'm starving here so give me peace. 
 It's all around us but still we search. 
 I see you there now i'm on fire. 
 What you think is fucked, it makes no sense. 
 What do you think I believe in this life. 
 Let me take you to a new atmosphere in this world. 
 Time for a start, I now begin. 
 Who is coming with me? 
 I'm ready to go back home. 
 I'm not living the way I should. 
 This seems to be my destiny, my reality. 
 This seems to be my destiny, this is my fucking life. 
 Nightmares of the future. 
 I'm left alone uncontrolled.
########### Exist ###########
I heard you say something quite uninviting 
 Are you aware the state were in 
 Hoping to cover the tracks behind us 
 Try to let the tension in your hands release 
 And exist in freedom 
 What doesn't tear you apart gives you peace 
 Exist in freedom 
 So what's wrong here? 
 Run into disaster 
 Renounce your command 
 The subject constructed your hate 
 Now I shield myself from pain 
 Showing my own expression 
 In the midst of this disorientation 
 I'm in the midst of a sinking wreck 
 A choice to be affected or permit extinction 
 Putting the power at your feet 
 In your authority 
 I won't lay my will down 
 Renounce your command 
 Try to let the tension in 
 your hands release 
 And exist in freedom 
 What doesn’t tear you apart gives you peace 
 Exist in freedom
########### Put To Rest ###########
Are you surprised that we ended up this way? 
 How could I not see this coming? 
 Let us show you how we operate 
 Give us the meaning of devotion 
 You lead us to the edge of corruption 
 And threw us in a pit of despair 
 Now we know you facing endless obstructions 
 The results of our concerns are near 
 Take notice of a changing dawn 
 My blood flows faster and faster 
 Feeling the pierce of destruction 
 I remember when the deal was almost new 
 We felt invincible and ready to 
 Play out of the situations 
 Now it's become too much for me to care 
 About who's up on the chain 
 Who's ahead of us today? 
 See what's its worth to reach a solution 
 Forward or reverse? 
 I don't know in this abyss 
 Gaining speed or just stopping faster 
 I can't master these thoughts 
 Show me the meaning of devotion 
 You lead us to the edge of corruption 
 And threw us in a pit of despair 
 Show me the meaning of devotion 
 You lead us to the edge of corruption 
 So receive then present 
 And be put to rest 
 Be put to rest 
 My dreams were just fiction 
 A loss of intention 
 The purposes you hold dear are not much to me 
 There dragging me down 
 Be put to rest 
 Stop pushing the limits 
 And be put to rest
########### A Descent ###########
I paint these walls to block my point of interest 
 There's no escape from these thoughts this time 
 I may be hiding but what other choice do i have left? 
 My safeties are at rest 
 So now we are 
 Passing the problems off 
 And throwing issues around that can't stand to be in motion 
 So slow down and cease to a halt 
 I'm only dragging myself down 
 Down to a state of dissatisfaction 
 Stuck in the corner of sadness 
 Is there anybody there to hear the cries? 
 They turn their heads the other way 
 I will never really be content 
 This cheap joyless buss is inadequate 
 I'm choosing the solutions carefully 
 I'm resolving 
 The present location of my conscience 
 Lies deep below the foundation in me 
 Wasn't aware of the consequences facing me 
 Descending slowly to the reaches of hell 
 To strangle and suffocate myself
########### A Higher Place ###########
Born into this skin 
 And made to walk before my wounds heal 
 Begin to start - to start to question 
 And make a new point of view 
 After all this suffering 
 You will bleed 
 You will see that the blood is clean 
 Put this up now just start over 
 Efforts to change our ways dead and broken 
 Can't stop what we have started 
 It's clear to me that this is over 
 It's over 
 The last one left to see this through 
 Here now we stand in peace and gratify 
 Lost in pain and made to wait 
 For everything you will be 
 Believe in nothing 
 Fuck the obscene 
 And remain 
 And it feels like we're going nowhere so let me take you to a higher place 
 I've seen this, this action 
 That made you hard to believe in 
 Stealing the truth ripped from inside 
 Why should I look at my situation unsatisfied? 
 Next thing I see won't be a surprise
########### An Ascent ###########
I am with you 
 Feel the shadows close on me 
 Losing out so try and see 
 My eyes will 
 Falling back into the ground 
 Flight drags on 
 Pick up yourself quietly 
 And let the next victim be your last 
 But this time a moment has already passed 
 This time I can see us looking back with a smile 
 Travel to a place be anxious and let's change 
 Retrace the way that we came 
 Let's never go back again 
 Forward we supply 
 We supply the weight on your shoulders 
 We're pushing until the last one subsides 
 Cast me down the depths 
 Your vision is unholy 
 But I'm not the one to save you 
 My outward march resides
########### Thrive ###########
We need to agree. 
 I have witnessed. 
 An abomination filling up the room. 
 Like I should have cared. 
 You know you've been here way too long. 
 Restore what has been done before the end. 
 Factor in the possibility of my life. 
 Give me the reasons to question the freedoms of life. 
 So I can survive. 
 Don't you ever go out of turn? 
 Do you ever listen to the answers? 
 Don't you ever see what's going on? 
 Restore what has been done before the end. 
 It will come down in time. 
 It's all on your side. 
 Show me what gives you strength. 
 We trusted you now how do we proceed? 
 Reaching out and receiving tranquility. 
 Are you feeling serene? 
 Though we thought it was all okay . 
 We don't warrant this covenant. 
 The agreement was thin and weak. 
 We need support you can't sustain. 
 You convinced me of everything. 
 But the words don't reflect my sentiment. 
 You could never hold on. 
 You could never face it.
########### Faces Of Death ###########
Drop my head in the concrete 
 Looking up at the sky 
 Reaching closer to my demise 
 Walking through this journey 
 No purpose or time 
 Reaching closer to my demise 
 Walking through this journey 
 No purpose or time 
 It captivates the eye unveiling the beauty 
 I'm where I need to be 
 Spinning with the sickness overcome by the change 
 My head and my mind co-inciting in assault 
 My actions transform to contention 
 So I'm disaluding the truth 
 Trading my will to comatose existence 
 A price that never paid and always be owed 
 Keep us alive hanging on a thread 
 And crawling forward 
 It's getting closer and closer to my demise 
 Looking up at the sky 
 Drop myself in the concrete 
 Looking up at the sky 
 IT was, Was it the end? 
 Bodies were deceiving me 
 Faces of death.
########### Follow The Signs ###########
Follow the signs 
 We are the victims but we are also the crime 
 And the only one who can judge us is the earth in time 
 I will show you more, a discovery 
 Beyond what you perceive 
 As you're tangled in thought, believe 
 And let your soul unleash 
 We're well on our way but they lead us astray 
 Perpetuate with distractions 
 As far as we've made only as one we can save humanity 
 The absence of what you hold dear it'll leave you stranded 
 Heartache will stem from fear 
 Ultimately the choice is up to you (the choice is up to you) 
 But in the end disbelief can't be denied can not be refused 
 They tremble in fear in the undercover sanctuary 
 And the walls disguise despair in the undercover sanctuary 
 I will show you more, we're uncovering 
 Let your soul unleash 
 The absence of what you hold dear it'll leave you stranded 
 Heartache will stem from fear 
 We are the victims but we are also the crime 
 And the only one who can judge us is the earth in time 
 We are victims yet we are the crime 
 And the only one who can judge us is the earth 
 Follow the signs
########### Singularity ###########
Reveal this operation 
 Phase on is history 
 It was just imagination 
 Of unreal technologies 
 What we saw through fiction 
 Has become reality 
 It's a call on all life 
 To rebuild 
 It's a call on all life 
 To rejoice 
 A pattern placed before your eyes 
 Will we see the end 
 A description of your demise inevitable 
 We are the creators for this age 
 Don't you be afraid to find your truth 
 To find your way you'll find your way 
 Don't be afraid life is not a game its a conscience 
 Living constant are you awake or just afraid 
 Concealed by separation unwilling to be unified 
 Call it dehumanization but I'll put up a fight 
 What we saw through fiction 
 Has become reality 
 The future of man is a cycle 
 So follow the science we use as we are 
 Running blindly into violent lifeless surroundings 
 Can we finally right this 
 Or just slightly unbind ourselves 
 From the nightmare will you dare to fight 
 Or collapse and invite the destruction the future 
 Of man is a cycle 
 Will you dare to fight 
 We rebuild tonight.
########### Ascension ###########
Raise your head up it's just one more step 
 Are you giving up now so close to knowing 
 The only hope that's left has been taken from view 
 A new journey awaits you 
 A new journey awaits you 
 Time to begin 
 A new journey awaits you 
 No one will ever break us 
 Join the experience 
 When you become ready 
 Encounter certainty 
 You will have to witness 
 All of this on your own 
 You will find the reasons 
 Not left to wonder why 
 Every moment matters 
 New discovered space 
 A shift of time is on its way 
 Together we will have to change 
 Another hope is known to me 
 Were gonna have to find our own beliefs 
 A new journey awaits you 
 Time to begin 
 A new journey awaits you 
 Looking up to a new idea 
 Were we all can focus 
 A mystery that's deceived 
 A subtle thought has been noticed 
 Of our ascension 
 Of our ascension 
 The transition has come 
 Enlightened and courageous 
 You know what you can become 
 Our journey has just begun
########### Devastate ###########
They will become the enemy 
 Suffering for eternity 
 No one can surrender 
 No choice but to bleed 
 The believers kill their own kind 
 Unless the followers take strike 
 To uphold our spirits inside 
 We must inform unstable life 
 You lost the connection 
 A blank interaction 
 Trapped in fear that all will be taken 
 Forget the past 
 As you take it in your hands 
 Take it in your hands 
 Take it in your hands 
 They will become the enemy 
 Suffering for eternity 
 The believers kill their own kind 
 Unless the followers take strike 
 To uphold our spirits inside 
 We must inform unstable life 
 Onto the horizon 
 Feel the future arriving 
 System failure 
 You know you can't stay this way 
 You know you won't be the same 
 The more you look outside this world 
 The more you can see happening 
 System 
 You know you can't stay this way 
 Failure 
 You know you won't be the same 
 System 
 The more you look outside this world 
 Failure 
 The more you can see happening 
 System failure 
 You know you can't stay this way 
 You know you won't be the same 
 The more you look outside this world 
 The more you can see happening 
 System failure 
 System 
 The more you look outside this world 
 Failure 
 The more you can see happening 
 Onto the horizon 
 Feel the future arriving
########### Recreate ###########
Here we all feel alive 
 Here we use our minds 
 Let us form together 
 Use our minds 
 Create, redesign 
 Visualize it 
 With a new world in our hands, we will gain control 
 With a new world in our hands, we will gain control 
 Recognize that you will never feel this way again (again) 
 And what you want is right in front of your eyes (this is the life) 
 So take it in, and embrace 
 No more wasted faith, ‘cause we are wrong 
 No more wasted faith, ‘cause we are wrong (‘cause we are wrong) 
 Don’t let it be easy 
 You needed such a direction to visualize perfection 
 Visualize perfection 
 You are wrong, you are free 
 This is serenity 
 Stop holding on for nothing 
 I’m ready to face this world and gain control 
 With a new world in our hands 
 With a new world in our hands 
 With a new world in our hands 
 Gain control 
 No more wasted faith, ‘cause we are wrong 
 We are at ease with the way we’ve grown 
 And only when the timing’s right 
 We can start to feel the stars align 
 Don’t let it be easy 
 Visualize perfection 
 Stop holding for nothing 
 Visualize perfection
########### Two Worlds Of Design ###########
Will we ever really learn of our creation 
 Or will this century 
 Claim the natural domain 
 Breakaway at a point when it's too late 
 Now the course is set 
 And our destination is our fate 
 A lesson learned will not remain 
 Gone past your call 
 See the complex set 
 You must explorate 
 Toward the promise land 
 The purity has taken leave with 
 The modern age supremacy 
 Manipulate the siege 
 Grant me the means to 
 Render useless the machines 
 To render useless the machines 
 We are falling into the circles 
 The smallest pieces 
 Are taking shape and taking charge 
 We combine two worlds of design 
 We are falling into the circles 
 The smallest pieces 
 Are taking shape and taking charge 
 Never thought connecting 
 I left myself inside the wires 
 I left myself inside the wires 
 Two worlds of design 
 Try living out in the open 
 The slightest change 
 Equals time inside the wires 
 The harmony of nature 
 Within the body of knowledge 
 Find life in the consequence of discovery 
 But there's still a mystery that blinds
########### A Solution ###########
My risen seeds will now begin 
 Spread out above now time to live 
 With fellow man I kneel 
 I seek a better sun 
 Unconsciously I feel 
 The solution of the world 
 We are still stuck inside the wires 
 Secrets in our eyes 
 Will call out for a new 
 Tomorrow before we ever knew 
 That it was in doubt 
 Let us foresee the future drought.
########### Shaping The Masterpiece ###########
I'm ready to go faster 
 Have you taken your seat 
 It's time we change things up 
 And let our impulse be the primary attraction 
 I'm looking at a disaster 
 A world that relies on deceit 
 The precious conveniences 
 Will leave us to only lose out faster 
 I've seen the blame at my feet 
 Allowed the evil to take me 
 Terminate the beliefs 
 That this is a masterpiece we're shaping 
 Embrace the slave ship 
 We are the undertakers 
 Taking Numbers 
 There is no direction from one another 
 Life is like a lesson can you interpret the truth 
 Why put your faith in question 
 If you cant see whats within you 
 Take a second to enjoy this 
 Before it passes right before you 
 I clearly see why 
 Theres no answer for me 
 Cause I'm falling asleep 
 At the wheel of discovery 
 Chasing a dream that out runs every being 
 You look soon enough 
 But you'll never start seeing 
 The meaning of mischief the reason we kill 
 The itch that's inside us to indulge in the thrill 
 The sound of freedom will ring through the air 
 When we decide to take charge 
 when we decide to care.
########### Dissimulation ###########
The inner demons have come out to play 
 How long have we been wrapped in decay 
 It keeps us blinded 
 They feed upon our hate 
 Only one sided beware of what awaits 
 Drilling into your superstitions 
 Taking a hold of you 
 Driving you to the ground, 
 In submission 
 Time to give up and surrender 
 Release the demons lost inside of us 
 We need to analyze our identities 
 Kept not alive just undone and surprised 
 I cant explain your survival. 
 Prove your history 
 Self prepared but not aware 
 Dissimulated networks 
 Can't explain it all its supernatural 
 Made out of every moment 
 Do you understand 
 You've been conditioned 
 Time to let go and surrender 
 I recognize the ones 
 Speaking against their own 
 Their powers are defenseless 
 We've been programmed.
########### Automatic Motion ###########
Came across an altercation 
 Of a destination to where we're heading 
 Speak the words of a certain secret 
 A failed attempt to hide what is out there 
 Tell me do you trust me to lead you 
 Tell me if your feeling alive 
 A quest to accomplish 
 The greatness we shelter 
 A unique elevation 
 The essence of wisdom surrounds me 
 This is instinct Automatic Motion 
 Incandescent signal 
 Insight will allure you 
 You must confront your inabilities 
 You must adjust to your capabilities 
 Tell me do you trust me to lead you 
 I can help you 
 Tell me if you're feeling alive 
 I can help you 
 Stolen hopes and dreams broken desires we all face 
 Protect the innocence within 
 Guard your intuition.
########### Last Straw ###########
This is your Last Straw 
 We all have been waiting for you to come 
 Maybe one day everyone will see 
 That it's all a stage 
 I don't need anyone to tell me lies 
 This is your Last Straw 
 Don't hold back 
 Keep on moving towards the front 
 Time is always against us 
 Your message will not save us now 
 Too many illusions your eyes 
 Are blinded from this truth 
 They will see soon 
 Everything will be alright 
 None will be forgotten 
 It's almost time nothing to be ashamed of 
 We will unfold this lie 
 This is your Last Straw 
 We understand and we know why 
 An action should be made 
 Does it make it easier 
 To think of your position 
 In the scheme of things 
 Opening your heart is the key 
 All the judgments will disappear 
 You've been facing this too long 
 A new path is seen 
 We understand and we know why 
 An action should be made 
 You've been facing this too long 
 A new path is seen 
 We understand and we know why 
 An action should be made 
 Communicate to the suffering 
 Translate their pain 
 Feel it so you can relate 
 Everything will be alright 
 None will be forgotten 
 It's almost time nothing to be ashamed of 
 We will unfold this lie 
 Opening your heart is the key 
 All the judgments will disappear 
 Searching for a sacred relief 
 The solution is here 
 Farewell to the prophecy of misery 
 Farewell to the kings of deception
########### Regenerate ###########
These are the things we're chasing 
 To reveal whats inside of you 
 These are the feet we're shaking 
 Soon they'll reveal 
 The inner powers too 
 In the element of truth 
 Try not to think so hard about it 
 We've reached a new perspective 
 Your negative ambitions 
 Will dissolve in our presence 
 Try not to let this consume you 
 The pain will only thicken 
 Your tired thoughtless unused mind 
 Will have a new beginning 
 These are the things we're shaping 
 To introduce a set of implications 
 Against your force of will 
 Closed eyes will never open 
 Closed minds there's no objections 
 Closed eyes will never open 
 Closed minds there's no objections 
 Can you comprehend the misdirection 
 It's so easy to give in 
 When you're facing counteraction 
 Ask yourself if you are ready 
 To self regenerate 
 A simple gift is waiting 
 No remorse for the ones who don't accept 
 I know everyday gives us a reason to breathe 
 A chance to fulfill our destiny 
 I will not relive my own mistakes 
 Do you feel no remorse for the ones who don't accept 
 I know everyday gives us a reason to breathe 
 A chance to fulfill our destiny 
 We're fortunate to live in this position 
 So why do you make it so complicated 
 To view a sense of recognition 
 You're stuck inside the womb of contradiction 
 We must make haste and breakaway from all this fucking madness 
 From all this fucking madness 
 We won't have it 
 All this fucking madness 
 Let's end this now 
 How did we get so far away, separate from ourselves 
 We will redeem our promise 
 That we would return one day 
 Divided no return of self 
 Misguided now return yourself 
 This could be a fantasy standing on the line 
 Between solid or transparency what am I distinguishing now 
 Closed eyes will never open 
 Regenerate 
 Closed minds there's no objections 
 Regenerate
########### Behold ###########
I can't stand 
 The bitter denial 
 Neglected consciousness 
 Forgotten rights 
 The book has been written 
 You cant change the ending 
 What is your confusion 
 Know your own condition 
 Lay down and think about how you've lived out 
 Your wasted time here is over and gone 
 They left us and we can start now our evolution 
 Expired, 
 Empty, 
 Expired, 
 Extinction 
 The refugees have deserted the city 
 No longer producing the age old concerns 
 Of how we can conquer and watch them crumble 
 It's far too late to question 
 They knew this would happen the book has been written 
 Set in stone now they've seen it now they know 
 Is this a miracle or imagination 
 your invention or destruction 
 We are here alone 
 At last we are finding answers 
 Reveal the meaning of what we really are.

 Tell me, what do you see? 
 Answers revolve around our heads like figures of our imagination 
 Measures are taken to purge pleasure and take life in as pain

 Form into agreement

 Revoke these patterns, undo routines

########### ∆bsolution ###########
New beginnings erase the weathered plain 
 Our direction shapes this diverse industrial age 
 Will we never forget 
 Will we choose to remain in 
 The age of traditional ritual 
 Gravity has brought us towards the universal living 
 Looking up and seeing the universal core 
 Overwhelming passion in all of us 
 Keeps on turning forever flowing 
 Til the sun dies out 
 If your light subsides you 
 We will observe the fade 
 Face to face with the forsaken 
 Face to face with your mistakes 
 You know you can't see what you believe 
 You know you can't see this 
 See what you believe 
 Rejuvenate transformation 
 All of these pieces contained in the inner body 
 Unify and formulate to design new clarity 
 Look into their eyes feasting on absolution 
 As they capitalize the condemnation 
 You know you can't see what you believe 
 Rejuvenate transformation
########### The Origin ###########
We conquered fate 
 Never abandoning our face, intricate 
 We will be found 
 Refusing the voice of doubt 
 Endless games you play 
 Why do you try to escape 
 When will it become worth it 
 To convince yourself that you're satisfied 
 When the obstacles have been so neatly placed 
 In your design sensors miscommunicate 
 The failure lies in distrust 
 Of your natural instincts 
 I've seen the shattering of my composition 
 What an unfortunate visualization 
 We must undo the damage imprinted in 
 Our experience has kept us all detained 
 Now our design fuses missed and severed links 
 It will take time to reconstruct 
 Our primitive instincts 
 The essence of observation 
 Has show us how to live 
 This passage in circulation 
 Gives birth to clarity 
 We are not alone 
 In this game of exchange 
 In this game of retaliation 
 We are not alone 
 Endless games you play 
 Why do you try to escape 
 When will it become worth it 
 To face the wrath in action 
 Erase establishment 
 To see they are worthless
########### ∆eon III ###########
Rise 
 Lift from your informal lives 
 The sun will come to us to provide 
 As we form from the ashes 
 Burnt, reborn 
 This century will thrive 
 The divine mother of earth 
 Showed us the way - gave us birth 
 Provided us with reason 
 Gave pure life clarity 
 But the truth of conception 
 Lied in able man 
 So the age of the pleasant 
 Fell from the mother's hand 
 A new generation born 
 Resurrected as the sun 
 A new aeon has begun 
 Surrender to the gods 
 As you flow through 
 The river of the sky 
 Come forth and display 
 The proof of your innocence 
 To the judge of souls 
 Will you pass to the judge of souls 
 The secret of death is revealed 
 Complete emergence 
 Into affirmation of the bornless one 
 A new aeon has begun 
 The insight of man's word: 
 Destroy the light, shade the earth 
 But our sun, resurrected 
 Gives new life on this world
########### Im∆gin∆ry Condition ###########
We endeavor to seek peace 
 In this state of control 
 Forced in formation 
 Uprise in the dead design 
 The newborn are faced with unreason 
 Shadowed by their imaginary conditions 
 What has been built 
 Brick by brick, with deception 
 Is bound to disrupt 
 Their false foundation 
 Reveal the answers 
 Placed inside our minds 
 React and question 
 Unveil the truth 
 We must react and construct 
 Restore the hope in us 
 Witness the shift as it comes closer 
 Our faction will become the defender 
 Here's your independence 
 Show them you're not defenseless 
 I set forth to find a connection 
 To bring peace to our foundation 
 I set forth to find a connection
########### Illusionist ###########
Should I believe in your prophecies 
 Does it lead me towards false ideals 
 Where is the evidence 
 Can you show me some proof? 
 This is irrelevant to the people you elude 
 Separate from all your wishful thinking 
 I want to prove what my heart is seeking 
 It's hard to focus with this distance 
 How can I mend this war between us 
 I've given all of my trust in what you believe 
 Will you be reaching back to me 
 Stay in this picture no further decay 
 The risk will come at a price I'm willing to pay 
 We were fearless with passion for life 
 Now are we forced to say goodbye 
 Programmed over time, adapted 
 Was I meant to take this path 
 Confined out of touch, absent mind 
 Set me free to feel alive 
 I placed my trust in you 
 I noticed the threat in our exchange 
 The days go on with no security
########### Source Field ###########
Do my senses deceive me 
 Obstructing the wavelengths 
 Forward motion is rising 
 To find what is sacred 
 Have I entered a new life 
 An extension of my perception 
 Can I retreat from this panic 
 From this tension 
 Or welcome the great unknown 
 Awaken, awaken 
 Into greatness 
 Not afraid to be in this space 
 Awaken, awaken 
 Into greatness 
 Manifest creation 
 We're home from the other side 
 And now we know (now we know) 
 The mystery was found 
 Enlightenment 
 We were chosen to show (show) you (you) 
 You were destined to become unnumbered 
 They will try to persuade you 
 And slowly destroy ones integrity 
 They might as well take you to the killing fields 
 And throw you away 
 You look back (you look back) 
 You risk it all (you risk it all) 
 Don't stray from enlightenment 
 Stray from the darkness 
 Come into the light 
 Come into the light again 
 Now your senses receiving 
 Constructing the wavelengths 
 The signals are seeking 
 We know what is sacred 
 We know this is constant 
 Aware of the source field 
 Alive in this form we venture together 
 In the great unknown 
 Stronger than ever 
 Arrive at the center 
 Of the great unknown
########### Venge∆nce ###########
We were built with the human condition 
 To expose the pain you create 
 No remorse for the weak and the hopeless 
 This the process of your extraction 
 Time to start a vengeance 
 Monsters instilled in us all 
 On the brink of eruption 
 The end result of life 
 Introducing a parallel existence 
 I want abstraction 
 We have been given the gift to proceed 
 So come on 
 We try to fill in the blanks you're missing 
 You need to open the door to begin 
 So come on 
 Will you be listening in 
 The storm has settled 
 It washed away your fear 
 We listened 
 They took us captive 
 We held on 
 Without thoughts imprisoned 
 The blood line has ended 
 Now your cause sees it effect 
 Reaction a little too late for a reaction 
 Enough is enough
########### The Other Half Of Me ###########
Watch my back, 'cause it will be in a grave next week 
 Watch my back, 'cause it will be in a grave next week 
 Who's to know, who's to calculate? 
 Life is meant to love and make mistakes 
 If I ever had a side that could boldface lie 
 And get away with it every time 
 It would be the man inside my head 
 Am I here or lost again? 
 I keep telling myself 
 (Telling myself) 
 This isn't how the story ends 
 I've come to paint the sky white and black 
 And when the morning comes, I won't be looking back 
 I know there's still beauty in the colors left to see 
 Somewhere inside I'll find the other half of me 
 I'll find the other half of me 
 The lines we break that make the shape of everyday routine 
 A step above the waves and chaos is simply me 
 Where's the heart and passion, don't hold back 
 The frames that make each day unique as we proceed 
 Progress ahead the past cannot be lived again 
 I keep telling myself 
 (Telling myself) 
 This isn't how the story ends 
 I've come to paint the sky white and black 
 And when the morning comes, I won't be looking back 
 I know there's still beauty in the colors left to see 
 Somewhere inside I'll find the other half of me 
 I'll find the other half of me 
 Who's to know, who's to calculate? 
 (It's the mystery) 
 Life is meant to love and make mistakes 
 You're not lost, I'm not dead 
 We are moving side by side 
 You're not lost, I'm not dead 
 We are looking straight ahead 
 Watch my back, 'cause it will be in a grave next week 
 Watch my back, 'cause it will be in a grave next week
########### Throw Me In The Jungle ###########
I'll leave my blood in the city 
 Throw me in the jungle 
 I can finally say I'm ready 
 Throw me in the jungle 
 Just let my lungs fill with smoke 
 Leave only my skin a match and a stone 
 We'll leave no corner left undone 
 The shadows run deep in the constant sun 
 As streets unfold we find our muse 
 She wears many faces she speaks our truth 
 Even if you're not the same 
 I won't turn my back on you 
 If I arrive to find myself letting the worst 
 Of you taking the best of me 
 You're taking the best of me 
 Throw me in 
 Should I trade sand for salt? 
 The elements seem to dissolve us all 
 In the end this is positive change 
 No matter where I stand no matter where I lay 
 This will be the light you live with 
 With a heart of fire 
 Set my body ablaze
########### Free Fall ###########
I fucking lost. 
 I fucking lost myself again 
 In the heat of the moment 
 Its a lost cause I know it 
 I try to be open 
 Still this feast will unfold 
 You dine and you know 
 How you corrupt my mind 
 But you can never destroy my hope 
 I lost myself again stuck in a free fall 
 You play the game and you always win 
 In the heat of the moment 
 I lost myself again your spirit is killing me 
 Stuck in free fall pictures and memories 
 You play the game and you always win 
 I know things will remain the same 
 I know I didn't fix anything 
 I fucking lost myself again 
 In the heat of the moment 
 Its a lost cause I know it 
 I try to be open 
 So I aim to pretend this won't happen again 
 You can disrupt my mind 
 But you can never destroy my hope 
 I lost myself again stuck in a free fall 
 You play the game and you always win 
 In the heat of the moment 
 I lost myself again your spirit is killing me 
 Stuck in free fall pictures and memories 
 You play the game and you always win 
 You can laugh you can smile 
 Feel your heart is open let your spirit free 
 In this light I think I'm starting to see 
 I know that your leaving me 
 And I wish I could feel apathy 
 Every time I close my eyes 
 All I see is your anatomy 
 A taste of what it used to be 
 Pictures and memories 
 A taste of what it used to be 
 Pictures and memories
########### Illuminate ###########
(Stand back) 
 Stand back and illuminate 
 Your presence begins to shape 
 History is bound to change 
 Stand back and illuminate 
 In this wreck I'll start to form 
 A new reason to believe again 
 It's hard to see the misery and doubt you breathe 
 I never thought I would see the end 
 Of your existence 
 Another dream that was broken from the distance 
 You build resistance now I'm indifferent 
 Now I believe in nothing 
 (From you) 
 Now I believe in nothing 
 (From you) 
 A fate to face the world in secret 
 You never thought you could love again 
 After a while the dream was dead 
 A way to connect is all you needed 
 A fate to face the world in secret 
 You never thought you could love again 
 After a while the dream was dead 
 A way to connect is all you needed 
 I'm ready to know, ready to see 
 I keep on searching what connects with me 
 The sensation of dissociation 
 Give me something to bring me peace 
 We are all 
 (We are all) 
 Searching for integrity 
 We are all 
 (We are all, we are all) 
 Searching for integrity 
 (Stand back) 
 Stand back and illuminate 
 Your presence begins to shape 
 History is bound to change 
 Stand back and illuminate 
 Another face a human counterpart 
 Behind a mask to deceive us 
 You're holding on and you know it's all a lie 
 Time to leave it all behind 
 (All behind) 
 A fate to face the world in secret 
 You never thought you could love again 
 After a while the dream was dead 
 A way to connect is all you needed 
 A fate to face the world in secret

 Is all that you needed

########### The Sleeping And The Dead ###########
As I witness, you fall behind 
 I continue and start to rise 
 Now you're after a droning daze 
 To fall back and to sulk in your shame 
 In connection we find a game so obvious 
 Planned from the start, can't explain why it distracts us 
 I'm delirious and the air is thinning 
 The room is spinning and I am sitting 
 Every breath I'm consuming my own doubt 
 It still keeps us alive (see theres an evil thats outraged) 
 Still it keeps us alive (resistance plays at our heart strings) 
 When the weight comes down (the weight comes down) 
 You reject it, just accept it 
 Thinking you need out 
 You create it, you can escape it 
 This urgency you feel each second 
 Will never leave don't ever think its the end 
 I'm delirious and the air is thinning 
 The room is spinning and I am sitting 
 Every breath I'm consuming my own doubt 
 It still keeps us alive (see theres an evil thats outraged) 
 Still it keeps us alive (resistance plays at our heart strings) 
 Alive to keep us reckless, with toxins in ours veins 
 While basic operators, follow directions and play the game 
 What you say in your head is not what you tell the world 
 It still keeps us alive (see theres an evil thats outraged) 
 Still it keeps us alive (resistance plays at our heart strings) 
 Destroying all my fears 
 Just as the picture is about to come clear 
 I dissemble 
 (Falling to the ground I) dissemble 
 (Shattered on the floor I) dissemble 
 (Picking up the pieces as I) dissemble 
 ... 
 Destroying all my fears 
 Just as the picture is about to come clear 
 I dissemble, dissemble

Unbind me from this cage I'm living in 
 From which I can't escape I need to get away 
 Unbind me from this prison, controlling so demanding 
 All colorless and grey 
 I can't take this expectations are getting in the way 
 Living in Silence Sheltered and afraid 
 If this is all that life is Then get me the fuck away 
 Its the timing reveal yourself Now unbind me 
 A cry for help 
 Open your eyes and make your story worth while 
 Reveal yourself 
 We've already come this far now its much too late to give in 
 Into security its frightening how numb it feels 
 Deny, don't descend into the grey 
 Running from your issues is not a strategy 
 Restart, invent a new reality 
 A cry for help 
 Unbind me from this cage I'm living in 
 From which I can't escape I need to get away 
 Unbind me from these shadows expanding suffocating 
 So dark and full of hate 
 As I'm leaving opposition is holding me in place

It's time to react 
 It's holding me back 
 If the design was built to fail 
 Can we avoid our absolute destruction 
 Could you feel a sense of doubt 
 The first sign arrived and showed us something real 
 Don't hide away don't consume and delay 
 Begin to trace the truth of our ways 
 Feel the need to see a direction 
 So we color in these imperfections 
 Don't hide away, don't hide away 
 Don't hide away 
 Begin to trace, the truth of our ways 
 I can safely say, it's love that connects us 
 When the weight of the world starts to break you 
 Gravity brings you down to reality 
 Will you lift up and join me in the clouds 
 Or stay planted to the ground 
 Will you cleanse your hands and eyes 
 From future corrupted minds 
 Don't hide away don't consume and delay 
 Begin to trace the truth of our ways 
 Feel the need to see a direction

 The world keeps spinning faster 
 I can't take this I won't make it 
 Its hard to relate when i hear you say 
 You tried to destroy me 
 Such cheap dishonesty 
 You failed to ignore me 
 Now you're descending 
 All the times we fought to avenge time 
 You lay down and surrender 
 Come up and take away 
 Broken dreams, unforgiven failures 
 This river of time 
 A fortune of gold 
 Enslave my crown 
 Revive my soul 
 I guess we're fighting the hours 
 So make each moment yours 
 I'm approaching the edge in a final defensive stand 
 So we're living it up and we're throwing away the plan 
 We're all in 
 You claw you fight but you always drown 
 We siege to be the true heroes now 
 In the failure I gained knowledge 
 In the memory I was let down 
 This river of time A fortune of gold 
 Enslave my crown revive my soul 
 Down stream in absence circles expand 
 Direct the folds on a line 
 Take my hand
########### The Composer ###########
And so we begin 
 Frame by frame we pick each vision 
 Who is your controller 
 Who is your composer 
 You're in denial and its hard to paint the picture 
 You've reached the end and its time to consider 
 Moving on 
 Don't let this pass you by 
 Keep moving on 
 These complicated fragments are going over my head 
 When confrontation comes you scatter with regret 
 We all need to listen 
 We all need to see whats on display 
 Rebuild what we've envisioned 
 Fighting a battle no one will win 
 Infatuated passion we know we're the same 
 Our dedication has us full of intensity 
 And so we conclude 
 Frame by frame we pick each vision 
 You are the controller 
 You are the composer
########### Absolution ###########
New beginnings erase the weathered plain 
 Our direction shapes this diverse industrial age 
 Will we never forget? 
 Will we choose to remain in the age of traditional ritual? 
 Gravity has brought us towards the universal living 
 Looking up and seeing the universal core 
 Overwhelming passion in all of us 
 Keeps on turning, forever flowing 
 Till the sun dies out 
 If your light subsides you 
 We will observe the fade 
 Face to face with the forsaken 
 Face to face with your mistakes 
 You know you can't see, can't see 
 Can't see what you (what you) believe (believe, believe) 
 Gravity has brought us towards the universal living 
 Looking up and seeing the universal core 
 Overwhelming passion in all of us 
 Keeps on turning, forever flowing 
 Till the sun dies out 
 Rejuvenate transformation 
 All of these pieces contained in the inner body 
 Unify and formulate to design new clarity 
 Look into their eyes feasting on absolution 
 As they capitalize the condemnation 
 If your light subsides you 
 We will observe the fade 
 Face to face with the forsaken 
 Face to face with your mistakes 
 New beginnings erase the weathered plain 
 Our direction shapes this diverse industrial age 
 Will we never forget? 
 Will we choose to remain in the age of traditional ritual? 
 You know you can't see what you believe 
 Rejuvenate transformation 
 You know you can't see what you believe 
 Rejuvenate transformation
########### Aeon III ###########
Rise 
 Lift from your informal lives 
 The sun will come to us to provide 
 As we form from the ashes 
 Burn (burn), reborn (reborn) 
 This century will thrive 
 The divine mother of earth 
 Showed us the way, gave us birth 
 Provided us with reason 
 Gave pure life clarity 
 But the truth of conception 
 Lied in able man 
 So the age of the pleasant 
 Fell from the mother's hand 
 A new generation born 
 Resurrected as the sun 
 A new aeon has begun 
 Surrender to the gods 
 As you flow 
 Through the river of the sky 
 Come forth and display 
 The proof of your innocence 
 To the judge of souls 
 Will you pass to the judge of souls? 
 Will you pass to the judge of souls? 
 The secret of death is revealed 
 Complete emergence 
 Into affirmation of the born less one (the born less one) 
 A new aeon has begun (it has begun) 
 A new aeon has begun (it has begun) 
 The insight of man's word (of man's word): 
 Destroy the light, shade the earth 
 But our sun, resurrected 
 Gives new life on this world 
 Rise 
 Lift from your informal lives 
 The sun will come to us to provide 
 As we form from the ashes 
 Burn (burn), reborn (reborn) 
 This century will thrive 
 This century will thrive
########### Exhilarate ###########
I need to take a step back 
 And I need to take a step back 
 I need to face the facts 
 That I'm intoxicated, but now 
 I need to take a step back 
 Save your sanity 
 You will be facing honesty 
 And I said I'd never leave 
 I need to take a step back 
 In this chase 
 My optimistic agenda's unchanged 
 What's at stake? 
 A separation that leaves me unscathed 
 In this phase 
 I am standing and you're drifting away 
 Now you're facing 
 A chance to prevail among the wrathful 
 Your silence has awakened my abilities 
 It's taking over 
 Take this message as a gift from me 
 You need to listen to your heart 
 Can you tell what it says? 
 We got the plan here 
 Deconstruct, construct a new life 
 And never push aside your instincts, stay alive 
 And never push aside your instincts, stay alive 
 I need to take a step back 
 And I need to take a step back 
 I need to face the facts 
 That I'm intoxicated, but now 
 I need to take a step back 
 Save your sanity 
 You will be facing honesty 
 And I said I'd never leave 
 I need to take a step back 
 I need to take a step back 
 This is endless power 
 Coursing through our veins 
 Triumphant in this hour 
 You will never look at us the same 
 This is endless power 
 Coursing through our veins 
 Triumphant in this hour 
 You will never look at us the same
########### Imaginary Condition ###########
We endeavor to seek peace 
 In this state of control 
 Forced in formation 
 Uprise in the dead design 
 The newborn are faced with unreason 
 Shadowed by their imaginary conditions 
 What has been built 
 Brick by brick, with deception 
 What has been built 
 Brick by brick, with deception 
 Is bound to disrupt 
 Their false foundation 
 Reveal the answers 
 Placed inside our minds 
 React and question 
 Unveil the truth

 Restore the hope in us

 Restore the hope in us 
 We endeavor to seek peace 
 In this state of control 
 Forced in formation 
 Uprise in the dead design 
 Witness the shift as it comes closer 
 Our faction will become the defender 
 Here's your independence 
 Show them you're not defenseless

 To bring peace to our foundation

 Answers revolve around our heads 
 Like figures of our imagination 
 Measures are taken to purge pleasure and take life in as pain

########### Vengeance ###########
We were built with the human condition 
 To expose the pain you create 
 (No remorse) No remorse for the weak and the hopeless 
 This the process of your extraction 
 Time to start a vengeance 
 Monsters instilled in us all 
 On the brink of eruption 
 The end result of life 
 Introducing a parallel existence 
 I want abstraction 
 We have been given the gift to proceed 
 So come on 
 We try to fill in the blanks you're missing 
 You need to open the door to begin 
 So come on 
 Will you be listening in? 
 The storm has settled 
 It washed away your fear 
 We listened 
 They took us captive 
 We held on 
 With our thoughts imprisoned 
 The blood line has ended 
 Now your cause sees its effect 
 Reaction, a little too late for a reaction 
 Little too late for a reaction 
 Enough is enough

########### Admit Defeat ###########
Time to open the curtains 
 Think of our time tonight as uncertain 
 Anything, everything can happen 
 Just open your minds to a new plan for mankind 
 We got a new vision for the future 
 A new formula to suture 
 If you live your life by fake laws and lies 
 There'll never be a the future 
 Why the fuck do we fall to our knees for the corporation 
 Refuse the system because the system will re-use you 
 We are the foundation 
 Tear it down, if you do one thing just think of consequence 
 of your life, the answers inside and now we'll stand together 
 There's nothing different about me 
 And your whatever you see is skin deep 
 Everyone in this life is linked, by forces unseen 
 There's nothing to gather 
 Just take a look around and you'll get the picture 
 If we do nothing we can be sure of one thing 
 We'll refrain, fall into shade 
 Fatal lies, just so your feel secure inside 
 Question your life, why are we here believing nothing else 
 Rise from the system, into a visions free 
 Free your mind and soul 
 We got this far just believe we can let go 
 Why the fuck do we fall to our knees 
 Why are we here believing nothing else 
 Rise from the system, into a vision, free from this ignorance 
 We got this far just believe we can let go 
 Now lets start digging deeper uncover what we know 
 Falling from madness we'll break through as one 
 I can tell you this great deception must have an ending 
 We can make it stop 
 Everybody's gonna reach out from distress at take some action 
 we'll restore the features that each of us 
 Choose to reap from, we say monuments are the future 
 Remember your way, just in case our light fades away 
 Remember your way, just in case our light fades away 
 Why the fuck do we fall to our knees for the corporation 
 Rebuild the system because the system will re-use you 
 We are the foundation
########### Degenerate ###########
Lives dismantled, piece by piece, shout 
 Before our eyes, powers disguise the truth while we decline 
 We are useful idiots 
 And every time we think it's gonna change 
 They're fuckin' with us 
 Disaster makes them grip 
 Much harder round our necks 
 Discontent is all around 
 Having lost all physical and mental qualities 
 I'm not considered to be normal or desirable 
 I will degenerate back to a mindless fuck 
 Like a decaying human parasite 
 Life's suicide 
 Why have all of our rights been violent in their deaths? 
 Why are we are so benign and motionless on request? 
 Oh, when did they cease to protect individual rights, forever we need 
 They're breaking us up from inside 
 They start by erasing our memories to claim riches like spinal sinews tearing 
 Old cultures replaced 
 Invent new history we forget what really was 
 In the struggle of man against power man will fall every time 
 Why have all of our rights been violent in their deaths? 
 Why are we are so benign and motionless on request? 
 Oh, when did they cease to protect individual rights, forever we need 
 They're breaking us up from inside 
 This is the day, this is the day we all die 
 This is the day, this is the day we all 
 This is the day this is the day we all die 
 This is the day we leave this sick world behind 
 Why can't I take a piece of your life, a piece of your life
########### Doxa ###########
This is the reason why I can't sleep tonight 
 They're killing on my left, dying on my right 
 Everywhere I look fills me with fear 
 Beliefs I once had become so unclear 
 I dare to rub out the lines draw from a new idea 
 But I'm stuck in this prison, stuck in this prison 
 No one can help me break free 
 Born sick commanded to be well 
 Stuck in a losing struggle 
 It's a dark existence meaningless and cold 
 Impossible to escape from 
 Trapped inside this fist of rage 
 Held down by the hand that made me 
 There is no escape while the shepherds block the gates 
 Now do I qualify for survival 
 I don't fear death like an American idol 
 Are we the ones that have to bleed 
 What luck that we don't think 
 Silent screams who wants to testify 
 Instinctively we try to hide 
 Breathlessly I hope to redesign 
 How I think amongst all these painted smiles 
 Nothing is set in stone 
 We fuel the machine that feeds of the death of our own 
 Nothing is what it seems 
 We follow the trend that keeps us in time 
 What is real? 
 Nothing is set in stone 
 We fuel the machine that's feeds of the death of our own 
 Straight away I wont hesitate to call you out 
 Straight away I can see that your all afraid 
 It's time to make up your own mind its time to make yourselves 
 Rectify beliefs 
 I won't be held down by the hand that made me
########### The Uncollective ###########
I thought you'd be afraid, I knew you'd lose it all 
 Just like the ones before you did another one 
 You made it easier to hate you, hate you 
 You have crawled up from the fear to manifest the gods 
 Betrayal from the ones that you know, all corrupt 
 No one is listening, until you stop 
 You stop acting like gods 
 I can't see outside the night, I won't be inside this fight 
 What are you here for? Why must you test me now? 
 Why are you fearful? Should we all go back home? 
 And count down the hours till it all goes to end 
 While desperate powers are fighting to keep their grip 
 Stop acting like you don't care 
 Stop preaching like it's the truth 
 What's the fucking point 
 Of living lifeless like this? 
 Of living lifeless like this? 
 Step down from the norm 
 Present me with a new way of thinking 
 And a new way of living 
 What are you here for? Why must you test me now? 
 Why are you fearful? Should we all go back home? 
 Count down the hours till it all goes to end 
 While desperate powers are fighting to keep their grip 
 This is the end 
 My body is lifeless and unforgiving
########### Blue Sky Thinking ###########
Infinite power, surely hides in their faces 
 What you didn't know, we're ready to take them 
 It's the time to act, we will remain free 
 We're ready for war 'cause we will not stop 
 I watch this world go running through our hands 
 We are paying a price for all the things we do not need 
 And the violence streams and I don't know 
 If we're living in another thousand years of greed 
 Can we face these lies 
 'Cause I hate to think what more we will do wrong 
 We were born to rise 
 (Upgrade this world, don't destroy it) 
 And our manifesto surely has to change 
 No, I won't be torn apart 
 By their bullshit thinking 
 No, I won't be torn apart 
 Strike my eyes, I can't quite believe it 
 We are cold inside for this blood is on our hands 
 Crawl, there won't be a man controlled 
 I'm not paranoid so go fuck yourself 
 We'll start to change this scene 
 Here we are inside a world of pain that isn't kind 
 Here we are inside a world of pain, it won't go away, no 
 Will never go 
 And this world is turned into a nightmare 
 The seizures in this hole won't go away 
 And it's hard for me to carry on 
 Our everything fades to grey 
 Can we face these lies 
 'Cause I hate to think what more we will do wrong 
 We were born to rise 
 (Upgrade this world, don't destroy it) 
 And our manifesto surely has to change 
 No, I won't be torn apart 
 By their bullshit thinking 
 No, I won't be torn apart 
 By their worldless actions
########### 97% Static ###########
Don't fall behind I don't wanna lose you 
 We can repair our eyes in heaven 
 It's a white night and without sight 
 I force my way through the crowds of sacrifice 
 And I started feeling at peace with you 
 All this destruction and decay makes me feel sick 
 Face the facts we can't wake up, we indulge ourselves like pigs 
 So I'll eat away the state and force every man to break 
 And take a good look at itself and everything 
 In the name of humanity in the name of liberty in the name of no god 
 The pressure is mountain high, excuses are always the same 
 We're living beyond our time, still it won't make us change 
 I wanna drown myself in drink so I'm senselessly drunk 
 Pollution crowds around me and I wanna get fucked up 
 But before they spend another billion on making it all worse 
 I'm gonna set sail on a mission that we can save ourselves 
 Can we save our selves? Can we save ourselves 
 I'll trigger a reaction in flames 
 It's beautifully insane 
 The pressure is mountain high, excuses are always the same 
 We're living beyond our time, still it won't make us change 
 Everything's breaking down, excuses are always the same 
 We're living beyond our time, still it won't make us change 
 We've broken everything
########### Denial ###########
I prevent the bullshit lies 
 Never thinking for a second death could be the fall of me 
 It's a long way down for us 
 And now they sing 
 On a quair drinking a part of human wreckage all alone 
 We see it Ritual mind control 
 Well I'm not basking in the crimson illuminating filth of the earth 
 I feel like we will never feel 
 Destruction is the one that I obey 
 Dysfunctional is nothing new 
 Believe me when I told there's no comforting answer 
 I feel like we should never feel 
 Confusion is a part of every day 
 I'm tired of being so afraid 
 They're poisoning the goo of our despair 
 Oh we should stop lying to ourselves 
 We are the virus and there's no guaranty 
 War far survival were living in denial crash it all 
 There should we fail and cop with reality 
 Antisocial behavior is the new crown 
 Where fighting back is the start of a cursed war 
 Is the start of a war 
 Oh, we should stop lying to ourselves 
 We are the virus and there's no guaranty 
 War for survival this place false thinking political 
 Living in denial crash it all with dignity outrage 
 The time will break us all 
 Gotta do quick there's a new law 
 Belies basking in the crimson illuminating filth of the earth 
 I feel like we will never feel 
 Destruction is the one that I obey 
 Dysfunctional is nothing new 
 Believe me when I told there's no comforting answers 
 I feel like we should never feel 
 Confusion is a part of every day 
 I'm tired of being so afraid 
 They're poisoning the goo with our despair
########### I, The Creator ###########
I, the Creator 
 In spite of making this, all I breathe 
 I'm sitting soulless in moments unforeseen 
 But I long to feel the breeze bound by this disease 
 Scars to take the place 
 Of open channels with no stream 
 I've got the answer, do I dare to heed? 
 Believe all things in effect 
 Will surely grow for now 
 Solace is the mission 
 Given to the organized 
 Pick a fucking side 
 With us or against us 
 We're moving forward for now 
 This is the end of promises made 
 That were never meant to hurt 
 (Let it go, let it go) 
 Forget what I said, I just want to 
 Watch you burn for promises made 
 That were never meant to hurt you 
 (Go, let it go, let it go) 
 Forget what I said I just wanna watch you burn 
 And if my time just came back to me 
 I wouldn't change a thing 
 Ablaze, this apparition burns 
 Your power is your own 
 Value the human spirit 
 Condemn yourself 
 Or choose to live 
 No more, we will form as one 
 Ready to fight you 
 With no surrender 
 We are ready to 
 Believe all things in effect 
 Will surely grow for now 
 Solace is the mission

########### Origin Of Escape ###########
Remain obsolete 
 It's better they think that the fire has taken us all 
 We run 
 No moment to wait or take your time 
 And they're hoping that it stays this way 
 My escape through the night 
 We distinct rebel 
 Taking to flight 
 Remain unforeseen 
 We're awaken the fire devised from the ash of my cells 
 Remain obsolete 
 It's better they think that the fire has taken us all 
 Make way, run 
 Onward 
 Like they took the first corrupted keepers 
 Witnessing the truth seeking two 
 Roses 
 This retribution will fall 
 Pieces of denial 
 The time will come to pay 
 Roses 
 My intention suffers 
 The living in time 
 Will thrive 
 Remain unforeseen 
 We're awaken the fire devised from the ash of my cells 
 Remain obsolete 
 It's better they think that the fire has taken us all 
 Make way run
########### Atlas ###########
Ways have changed 
 Guiders of the open wind you make me understand 
 Again and again you make the same mistakes 
 I can't ask to make that change 
 Their bodies official 
 The guardians of the stream 
 Now, we're sailing across the world 
 Provided a place to stay 
 Whatever the cost that makes us different 
 Dare to look away 
 For better or worse I'm sure 
 We'll ride along this wave 
 Whatever the cost that takes us distant 
 Dare to walk that way 
 The great ocean takes laughter with hollowing 
 How could we live inside of a ship that's been slowly abandoned 
 Taken by the cold? 
 We're drifting away 
 We're drifting away 
 We're sailing away 
 We're sailing away 
 Now, we're sailing across the world 
 Provided a place to stay 
 Whatever the cost that makes us different 
 Dare to look away 
 For better or worse I'm sure 
 We'll ride along this wave 
 Whatever the cost that takes us distant 
 Dare to walk that way
########### Garden Of Sankhara ###########
And there is death in the air everywhere 
 (All around me) 
 Through the night I won't make it anymore 
 (No) 
 But I forget that I couldn't make all the same bad mistakes 
 Like the ways of the ancients, everything has to change 
 I would do anything to remove and erase 
 Just denial face to face 
 Who wouldn't take my place? 
 Hey, are you the Garden of Sankhara? 
 Hey, are you the sound of time? 
 You know the mess that I wait to need 
 But then I see you there 
 A bed of soul that you made of me? 
 They're dancing on your fucking death 
 I'm moving to a place 
 Then I can reshape these god damned vines 
 (I know on your own you will fall) 
 I'm moving to a place that I can't escape, I hope they let me stay alive 
 (I know on your own you will fall) 
 But I forget that I couldn't make all the same bad mistakes 
 Like the ways of the ancients cause everything has to change 
 I would do anything to remove and escape 
 Just denial face to face 
 Who would you dare to bring back to me? 
 Who's in the mirror that I'm near to see in between 
 The misty state of this waking dream 
 And standing at the fall 
 Reflection lead the way 
 Reflection lead the way 
 Hey, are you the Garden of Sankhara? 
 Hey, are you the sound of time? 
 Destiny, a hollow ghast that a patient sees 
 Or are you really there? 
 Hey, are you the sound of life? 
 You know the mess that I wait to need 
 But then I see you there? 
 A bed of soul that you made of me? 
 They're dancing on your fucking death
########### The Alchemist ###########
We all live in a world where thoughts are overtaken by chaos 
 Realize I can't live with this, I'm living life in the sick 
 Designed benign, how could you ever know there is a better way? 
 There is a better way! 
 No more 
 (No more) 
 Being run around 
 (Become the light) 
 If I 
 (If I) 
 The world bends around me, become the tide 
 Through standing this harm, become the tide 
 The world surrounds me 
 I'm alone, but I make the most of borrowed time 
 Forever eternal, the terms of old 
 Whispering in secret, they're questioning it 
 Who am I 
 To fight his lighting line of creation? 
 Who will fight 
 Foretold ages sent of mystic voices? 
 Think with your memory 
 Think for your family 
 Everything's written for one 
 Redefine 
 We'll change everything, I know that we can do this 
 Hold on a love-line 
 As all burns 
 The world bends around me become the tide 
 The devil's deep inside 
 The devil's deep inside 
 The devil's deep inside 
 I see it as undone 
 Do what it ever takes 
 (Taking over) 
 Let it all go 
 (Taking over) 
 Let it all go 
 You wanna make it, it's already gone awry 
 It's a ring of fire 
 Through standing this harm, it's already gone 
 They'll step on your will 
 they'll stand on your faith 
 they'll wither you down to nothing and then some 
 It's better to hold deep and stand alone 
 Having spent this quest without questioning it 
 Who am I 
 To fight his lighting line of creation? 
 Who will fight 
 Foretold ages sent of mystic voices? 
 Think with your memory 
 Think for your family 
 Everything's written for one 
 Redefine 
 We'll change everything and all that we survive
########### Samsara ###########
She returns with blood on her feet and wings on her back 
 Now she returns with words in her head 
 With a song in her heart, in her heart to free us all 
 With a kiss to free my soul, this is the end 
 This is the end

########### A Steady Decline ###########
The secret's out, this is the last time. 
 Cast overboard, dragged out to sea. 
 All premonitions drowned today in the murky waters flowing from wounds. 
 But we emerged soaked in grace, dripping with the truth. 
 You've fired upon a target so clear, but we've shattered our own glass hearts. 
 We've fought with sweat and blood, this life is all we have. 
 Today has taken a bloody toll, but the nightfall will claim your life. 
 Claim your life tonight. 
 Her majesty will swallow you, she'll devour you. 
 Yet here we stand at this eulogy dripping with the truth. 
 You fired upon a target and we fired back. 
 We fired back on your stronghold. 
 We devastated all defenses. 
 Regret consumes you. 
 Regret becomes us all.
########### Isolation Theory ###########
So this is loneliness, I've grown too fond of this. 
 Now i thirst for loveliness, to drink its beauty. 
 I'll never fill my cup if i can't seem to free my frozen heart. 
 Torturous veins tangle this.. this body. 
 A scream of anguish, silenced by the distancing to anyone. 
 So this is loneliness. I know this all to well. 
 Wrap me in your wings of amity. 
 Torturous veins tangle this.. this body. 
 A scream of anguish, silenced by the distancing to anyone. 
 Isolation is a four letter word. 
 Through my bloody hands i see my heart reach the ground. 
 No one is there to pick it up from the floor.
########### The Forfeit ###########
Every time your lips spill their poisonous words, 
 they infect the ones you claimed to have cared for. 
 We are gored by your serrated ways. 
 We shed our faith, we've bled oceans for your cause. 
 We shed our faith in your atrocity. 
 We've come to claim a thousand lives to live. 
 Open hands will shape what little time we have. 
 We exude our servitude to a lifetime of deceptive worship. 
 [Righteous hands will rise,] If only to redeem the city of the gods. 
 And in ourselves we trust. 
 A thousand fists will rain. 
 This mighty downpour will wash away. 
 There is new hope in every open eye. 
 Promise to ourselves that these words will never die. 
 We exude our servant hood to a lifetime of immoral worship.[ 
 Righteous hands will rise,] If only to redeem the souls of the meek. 
 Burn your spores so your plague will not manifest in the hearts of the innocent. 
 And when the blackest day becomes forever grey, 
 the ash will scatter of what has not remained. 
 The ashes have buried you. [x2]
########### Fingers Like Daggers ###########
[Your feminine] Fingers are like daggers. 
 Tearing me apart with each caressing stroke, 
 My scars unravel cruel.. cruel history. 
 Our love was stab wounds and lusty kisses. 
 In your eyes I see wasted tears for wasted years, 
 and heartache, heartfelt for granted. 
 You left me with nothing but the desire to overcome. 
 This gaping wound from where you stole my vital organ. 
 But keep it with you, a trophy for yourself. 
 Still you linger for another gaze. 
 Die away from me. 
 I won't stand by while you plague the air with your lies and deception. 
 My shirt stained crimson from long nights of anguish. 
 These scars are forever, but this won't be eternity. 
 You wash away guilt in the oceans of my tears. 
 I will drown you in the oceans of my tears. [x2]
########### Forging A Future Self ###########
Please cut this noose, untie these hands for me. 
 They will insurrect my former self. 
 Hide behind your failed design. 
 Perfect its imperfections. 
 I'll carry out the plans of old. 
 I'll dig through the remains of my ruins. 
 I'll dig through the remains. 
 Unearthing something, truly remarkable, 
 once hidden by your opaque heart. 
 I'll carry out plans of old. 
 Digging through the remains of my ruins. 
 From this day forth, your love will poison no longer. 
 A strange suffocation, enticing existence. 
 It's comforting, the artificial life. 
 A ghostly bliss without your kiss. 
 Never grasping what you've hoped for. 
 [Your] Translucent hands pass through the sunlight. 
 You'll never feel that loving glow. 
 Damned to be deprived of the blissful warmth of heaven. 
 As you dissipate into shadows.
########### Warm Thoughts Of Warfare ###########
[The] Waking hour of scarlet warfare, I will fight for you. 
 This blood will wash away. 
 Their skin will crack and peel in a thousand fires. 
 We will break every bone, we will crush them all to dust. 
 An attempt so frivolous to save your life. 
 Watch you hit the sanguine ground like autumn leaves. 
 With each nail driven you drift away. 
 This somber burial is a calamity. 
 Rise from your casket and kiss new breath from me. 
 To those who can't behold your fading moonlight beauty, 
 radiating from your precious eyes, a tender gaze. 
 Never witnessing an instance when you held time still forever in your matron hands. 
 Rise from your casket revive this effigy. 
 New life will feed your starving lungs. 
 New blood will surge through collapsed arteries, 
 and I'll hold you through it all.
########### Engulfed ###########
The sweltering heat sweeps through the blood, raising internal rage. 
 The escalation of annoyance converts fingers to fists. 
 Ready to smash the moral wall restraining the release, restraining the release. 
 Wash over placid with flooding waves of hate. 
 Diverge the silence with cathartic piercing screams. 
 Unleash on your enemies a sweeping firestorm. 
 Laying devastation upon those who haze you. 
 Forever they curse you. 
 Forever loathing the day they unraveled the fabric of your innocence. 
 Gnawing at every tame fray, leaving only vengeance.[x2] 
 A sheltered source of inspiration for your master plan to lay everything to waste. 
 With no aggressor, without a foot to stamp out every garden of hope. 
 Plant a row of remorse, and a crop of forgiveness. 
 Raise yourself in a better world.
########### Redeeming The Wretched ###########
When the bite of the steel catches your face, 
 give it all your flesh to strip away. 
 Revealing all the scars you hide inside. 
 Your inner quarrels, your struggle to survive. 
 A crimson hand to choke your throat. 
 I'll stop your breath as long as it takes. 
 To end this torture, clearing a forest of oppression. 
 Can you taste the soil as it fills your lungs? 
 To extinguish the fire, the fire burning in your eyes. 
 You cannot stop the scorching. We'll lay you down on your eternal bed. 
 The soothing touch of a wrathful hand. 
 You leave the sky, encased in the earth. 
 Can you feel the roots as they seep inside your heart? 
 A crimson hand to do the will of god. 
 We'll wipe you out to clear the land for angels. 
 With the turning of the tide.
########### Berzerker ###########
On your guard as you lurk along the sand, 
 A paper face won't mask your fear. 
 Unrelenting consequences for this inquisition, 
 Venture forth and give yourself away with the scent of unfamiliarity. 
 For razor teeth love their human silk, 
 They long to savor unexpecting flesh. 
 To drink a carcass dry is to taste the Sunderban. 
 Mighty one, never forget, never forget why your skin is thick. 
 Die defending that which your heart keeps closest. 
 The taste of vengeance is so much sweeter on the blackest of lips. 
 The wind whispers trespass, a call for an end. 
 Take up your arms, set your sights. 
 Never fear, there's always more blood. 
 Retaliate! 
 At ease mighty one, this war is not one of your own. 
 The king returns to claim his throne, 
 A humble crown adorns his noble brow. 
 As the killing season comes to a close, 
 Take what's left and start again. 
 As you strive to regain all aspects of your grief ridden life, 
 Living each day with strength found in your heart.
########### Drifts ###########
Oh, so fucking cold. 
 The winds, the drifts of winter, 
 Bonechilling nightfall. 
 Early evening sundowns 
 Make nights seem more like borealis dreams. 
 My roots run deep, through veins, my ancestry. 
 Everything I know, in body and soul. 
 Lakeland. 
 Look to the river rushing, 
 Unparalleled its power. 
 It carves away at the land. 
 Eroding the banks, consuming the sands 
 And washes away to her majesty. 
 They say, there's no other place like home, and they said it best. 
 I've realized what this place means to me, Lakeland. 
 I can see my reflection in the land, I see my form. 
 And I know the land reflects in my self. 
 It reflects in my self
########### Cursing Akhenaten ###########
Awaken, ruinous fiend of early generations. 
 Your rotting corpse is restored. 
 Straighten your limbs, brush off the dust, 
 Withered bandages restrain you no more. 
 Severed heads accent the gates, 
 Bones emerge from the sands, 
 Proof of your reign remains. 
 I, your liege, now command your rule again. 
 The sun burns through the skin, boiling vital organs within, 
 But the gods can't destroy my cursed, blackened heart. 
 Appeasing the thirst of the damned, mocking the praised ones. 
 The sand soaks the blood, the blood flows like wine, send death from above. 
 Locusts and famine engulfing your race, my savagery knows no end. 
 At the price of all your lives, I destroy your kind, death by my hand. 
 Sands blowing across cursed lands 
 Will consume the evidence of your ancient existence. 
 The Earth is now black from the torment I have set upon it. 
 All shall bow, serve, and praise thy name.
########### Rareform ###########
A thousand times, too many times, 
 I've fallen back out of place from a dream. 
 The bright sunlight, a rude awakening, 
 Like I'm seeing the colors leave the brush for the wall... 
 That's when, into... 
 I reach into memories, 
 I long to relive those times, 
 Those younger days. 
 If only time would stop, stand still, 
 Maybe I could see myself, 
 What I've become, it's sickening, this isn't me. 
 No turning back now. 
 No turning around. 
 I'm disappearing into my dream, 
 I'm vanishing into the air. 
 Liberation, I'm free from all of this. 
 Now I must go, now I must go, dissipate into the lights...
########### Aspiration ###########
Victim of anger, tied to distance 
 Where does it come from? 
 Distrust. 
 I've stood strong, 
 Held my head high through constant war. 
 So brutal, so violent. 
 So I tiptoe through conversation, 
 A lapse in my step is misperceived. 
 Unleash a breath of salvation, 
 In dormancy lies everlasting. 
 Remember all the fires we started? 
 Our aspirations for progression. 
 We feed the burning for a better day, 
 Don't let your selfishness extinguish the flame. 
 Prevailing with lasting intentions, 
 Never living behind your back. 
 Never living behind your... 
 Convictions leave me questioning 
 If you've been living behind mine.
########### The Fractal Effect ###########
This is where you pick yourself up, brush off the ashes. 
 Clear the smoke and soot from your eyes. 
 Their word brings desperation, just look around you. 
 Renewed visions reveals the lies. 
 My truth will be my own. 
 My truth will be my own. 
 You say it doesn't matter, get used to fear. 
 I tell you, that's the problem. 
 Get used to the lies. 
 They mislead your pride. 
 You blind them with your light. 
 Jut strand this from the mind. 
 You say it doesn't matter, get used to fear. 
 I tell you, that's the problem. 
 What it's done to you, the way you live your life. 
 Pick yourself up. 
 What it's done to you, the way you live your life. 
 An empty state of bliss, an empty state of mind. 
 A state of empty bliss pulled into the depths, 
 Dragged out with the tide. 
 My truth will be my own and not the one they gave me. 
 My truth will be my own and not the one that they gave me.
########### Ometh ###########
I'm falling away 
 Away from myself 
 Away from who I used to be 
 Arid skin cracked and torn, I peel it away 
 A change for the better to harness the strength and rise more powerful 
 Now more powerful than ever 
 A decrepit self once animate, now abandoned and left to rot 
 Nothing to be salvaged, nothing to be saved 
 Now follow the thrashing thought of your dream to exist 
 Persue what may never come 
 Releasing demons and banishing them to the depths of bloody memories and regrets 
 The outer shell is decomposing, releasing a new upgraded self 
 Bleeding ink reveals the price of expansion 
 Push it down, its hideous face below the water 
 Watch what was become never again 
 Let nothing stop you for when it lived, it showed no mercy 
 Now show it no remorse 
 Cut compassion from your mind 
 Forget what it means to cherish life 
 Now following the thrashing thought of your dream to exist 
 Pursue domination
########### A Vicious Reforming Of Features ###########
Creator as observer 
 Congruent systems collapsing 
 Mutating waveforms to become sight, sound, touch 
 A sick perception is now my only link to reality 
 Scorched eternally blistering 
 Yet I prevail 
 My merciless plan of creation etails seeing the unseen forge an abomination 
 with a cold hearted sense of compassion, devastation 
 Thy vicious modus operandi 
 Observer as creator 
 Beguiling unstable electric forms 
 These fools of judgment, they thirst for unpute 
 Draining a carcass, devour the contaminate and filth that roams amongst us, 
 sterilizing our human forms 
 Shredding tissue, fracturing bone 
 Burning synapse, rewriting conscious 
 A burial reforming of features 
 A hideous cleansing of God 
 Self purification achieved when whats left behind is devoid of deformations
########### My Frailty ###########
I remember your taste, you're the life I gave away. 
 Failure wrapped around my neck, you're the ghost that held me back. Now I am Letting go. 
 Drowning my self in the frozen waters. I feel words escaping. 
 They break from my thoughts and disappear from my mouth. 
 They leave behind a a taste, a teaste of failure, so familiar it reminds me of you. 
 Don't say you'll save my life. 
 I never asked you for anything, but you wanted more. 
 Drowning in your frozen waters I was sinking, you were my frailty. 
 Drowning in your frozen waters, don't say you'll save my life. I'm vanishing, I'm giving up on myself. 
 Closing my eyes forever. 
 Throw my body, into the wind spinning and twisting I bend into something else. 
 A catastrophe, a murderer of my hopes and dreams. 
 This is not my life. 
 When winter ends, my new life begins. 
 Bend and break, in pieces I was for you. 
 You were my frailty don't say you'll save my fucking life.
########### Your Troubles Will Cease And Fortune Will Smile Upon You ###########
When i return 
 I dream of another life 
 Failure transparent in the palm of my hand 
 I am the contortionist 
 We are the contortionists 
 I can feel this distance is further and farther without you 
 Contorting to fit somewhere i do not belong 
 Brick by brick 
 Stone on top of stone 
 I create 
 From these towers 
 Built of nothingness 
 I will fall 
 And like these wordless feelings 
 There is an emptiness we long to feel inside 
 Father when will you come home? 
 I have been dying inside 
 Mother where have you gone? 
 Oh so how hard i've been trying 
 Hours upon hours 
 I am fucking sleepless 
 We are wretched, no sleep for the wicked 
 And at night we come undone 
 This is not who i ever was 
 We are anything 
 We are the contortionist 
 We are the wordless feelings 
 We are the great divide 
 We are the emptiness we long to feel inside 
 We are anything 
 We are the contortionist
########### Pendulum ###########
Breathing 
 I am fading 
 I feel I am losing myself 
 Wishing I could be someone I'm not 
 I know somewhere there's a mirror that can show me who I am 
 Because I will never know 
 Constantly bending 
 Engulfed by my history 
 So scared of letting go 
 Beyond everything 
 I wish I could be 
 I am just a man 
 The sun will never shine for me 
 I am lost inside the meaningless 
 We lose control 
 Like a pendulum 
 I forgot where I came from 
 Holding on to the weight of regret 
 We lose control 
 Swing me back and forth again 
 You gave and you bled 
 Now I'm picking up the pieces of my broken heart 
 Blocked out 
 My shattered glass past 
 Now I'm picking up the pieces I have swept away 
 We lose control 
 Swing me back and forth again
########### Bread Crumbs & White Stones ###########
So I'll keep searching, for a place called home. 
 I'll rip my roots from this earth, into the unkonwn. 
 Is it for the dreams I chased or the ones I caught, this mystery this misery is killing me. So now I'll leave behind a murder scene, my life isn't real, it's just a silhouette and when the sun goes down, I won't exist. 
 I will be forfotten, bread crums and white stones can't follow me. 
 Overwhelming, constantly i'm tearing at the seams, the threads that hold me together, they envelop me. I am a shaking man. 
 As my body breaks against the wind, I begin slowly to unravel. 
 Overwhleming, I'm tearing at the seams, the threads that hold me together they envelop me. 
 And with fervor I am everywhere I thought I never would be. 
 I will never come home, I am a ghost inside your empty house. 
 I don't exist. 
 I will not come home, I'll never come home.
########### To Carry You Away ###########
Who we are I'll never know, but when we spoke I knew you well, you loved me through and through. I never thought I would watch you leave us, from a room as a kid I held so close. 
 I was a son made up of sand, you where the wind that let me go. 
 I'll say goodbye, so this is goodbye. 
 But I'm afraid to speak, so with words I'll tell the stoey, you meant so much to me. 
 And like the nights upon the nights to come, I will dream of you, and know that I will see you soon. 
 Give me the strength to sarry on. 
 Tide you are the ocean tide, the swells swept you away, I was a son made up of sand, you where the wind that let me go. 
 When the ocean tide has risen to high and waters have come to carry you away. Remember I will always be there to sing you to sleep
########### Sleeper ###########
I could never find a way to rest upon your shoulders 
 Misunderstood, please help but i meant so well 
 I keep pushing through these bitter memories 
 I try to to escape the nightmares but they are becoming of me 
 I am the sleeping dream inside the dream 
 My old me breaks my heart 
 I hope i never wake up 
 I need an answer 
 Please help me 
 This endeavor has swallowed me whole 
 North winds twisting inside me i can feel this emptiness 
 Slowly i am fading out 
 I can feel this emptiness 
 Slowly i am fading out 
 And this is becoming of me 
 My hands hold on tight, i'm not letting go 
 Words are never good enough 
 Everything i breathe is broken letters and bad timing 
 And they are becoming of me 
 I am the sleeping dream inside the dream 
 I hope i never wake up
########### Promises Kept ###########
This is my promise to write to you 
 So for you my every word 
 Is the sinking feeling here in my chest 
 I am so far from home but the further away we are the closer I am 
 The closer I feel, the further you get 
 My hands hold on tight to your every word 
 I won't let go, but I feel my eyes advert from who I used to be 
 We know the storms will come 
 The winds they will sweep us all away 
 We know the storms will come 
 Wrap me in your silver lining 
 Torn between the roots of earth and the sky 
 I left my heart behind, and I'm so far from home 
 I left my heart behind, and I'm so far from home 
 The weight is pulling me down, in your circles I am spinning 
 The weight is pulling me down, in your circles I'll wait forever 
 The weight is pulling me down 
 The weight is pulling me down 
 The weight is pulling me down 
 The weight is pulling me down 
 Lost control, my hands grip the wheel 
 But I can't see where the road is leading 
 Please hold on dear I know you're worried 
 Counting down the days do you remember? 
 Torn between the roots of earth and the sky 
 I left my heart behind, and I'm so far from home 
 I left my heart behind, and I'm so far from home 
 Torn between the roots of earth and the sky 
 Torn between the roots of earth and the sky 
 Torn between the earth and the sky, I left my heart behind 
 Torn between the earth and the sky, I left my heart behind
########### Encased In Ice ###########
I have been to the edge before, at the end of the world 
 But there is nothing for me so i guess i'll just turn around 
 I will follow my footsteps back home 
 Still the same as before, but there is nothing for me 
 So i guess i'll just turn around 
 Can't you see that i'm suffocating? 
 In a world that means nothing to me 
 My only hope is disintegrating 
 Wishing someone could carry the weight for me 
 Can't you see that the ends beginning? 
 In this life i've lost all i know 
 Because hope is a word, that i forgot was feeling 
 So please hold onto me and i won't let you go 
 We are nothing more than memories 
 I'll find the meaning inside this doubt 
 I will see this through 
 I'm frozen in time, encased in ice 
 Break me apart so i can breathe again
########### Anti-Pattern ###########
I am a shadow slipping into the abyss 
 A part of me that will never leave 
 Just to remind me of who I have grown to be 
 Pulling me side to side, it won't forget me 
 I'm watching where I step 
 So I don't fall between the cracks 
 An anti-pattern in disbelief 
 Yeah 
 I can't convince myself to be better than I am 
 I am the watcher 
 This is a severance 
 We are waiting for the signs 
 It'll take more than fortune and shooting stars 
 To keep me from falling 
 I unwrap myself 
 I dissolve 
 Into one-thousand pieces 
 Huh 
 I am a shadow 
 Slipping into the abyss 
 A part of me, a part of me, a part of me 
 Never leave
########### Of Fearful Men ###########
Underwater 
 There is no chance of breathing inside this vessel 
 Blue lipped and anemic 
 We are constantly questioning our safety 
 So much pressure, we struggle 
 I just want to give in 
 Please help me 
 To keep the waters from crashing over me 
 This ship is sinking, my heart is palpitating 
 Your God won't save you 
 We bend and twist from distant ends 
 Waves crash together blind without warning 
 A great deluge envelop everything 
 And all that's lost was taken 
 Oh, I cannot believe this is happening 
 Please just give me one more chance 
 Pressed within your trembling hopeful hands 
 Intangible, you're wasting time 
 Steel rivets snap and moan 
 Intangible 
 Your God won't save you 
 Now, the welds are breaking down 
 My hands are shaking now 
 The welds are breaking now 
 Oh, what a shame 
 You can't hide 
 Crush the mast, envelop all 
 Your palms together won't keep us from sinking 
 You can't hide 
 Crush the mast, envelop all 
 Your palms together won't keep us from sinking
########### Pennyweight ###########
Fuck yeah, ow 
 Where have I been? 
 Blearing pacific winds 
 Crossing foothills, constructing stories 
 Ruptured earth 
 Guiding me home 
 Romantic fault lines 
 A bridge's quake in my bones 
 A place we called home 
 A distance we have learned 
 Pull me in and help me out 
 I want to swim amidst the satellites 
 Sinking to the bottom, I exhale 
 Close my eyes, disengage 
 Here there is no there 
 (Give me) 
 indication, 
 (give me) 
 separation 
 With everything seeming pulse-less 
 (Give me) 
 indication, 
 (give me) 
 separation 
 I'm drifting into oblivion 
 And there's no place that I'd rather be 
 (Give me) 
 indication, 
 (give me) 
 separation 
 I'm drifting into oblivion 
 Isolated in black 
 My thoughts spin, my worlds divide 
 I am lost in space 
 Burning up in the atmosphere 
 When I finally come crashing down 
 Wrap my bones inside miracles 
 A safe place, I am finally home 
 Pull me in and help me out of this hemisphere 
 I want to swim amidst the satellites 
 Sinking to the bottom, I exhale 
 Close my eyes, I disengage 
 Here there is no there 
 (Give me) 
 indication, 
 (give me) 
 separation 
 With everything seeming pulse-less 
 (Give me) 
 indication, 
 (give me) 
 separation 
 I'm drifting into oblivion 
 Now I'm slipping away 
 So 
 (give me) 
 indication, 
 (give me) 
 separation 
 With everything seeming pulse-less 
 I'm drifting into oblivion
########### Disconnect ###########
The sway of distance, a suffering march 
 Lives tremble on and on 
 We usher burdens that see us through 
 Blinding light emanates guiding me from within 
 Guiding me from within 
 Guiding me from within 
 For I am just part of who I was back then 
 Where we were when this all began 
 Inside this vision I am no longer 
 No longer in control of my own life 
 Sickened by surroundings, occupied and weak 
 Tangled and desperate, I expand 
 I am paper thin 
 Lines etched and carved from misery 
 Somebody help me please 
 Because I can never leave this place 
 I am afraid of becoming you 
 I'll deconstruct myself 
 For I am just a part of who I was 
 Where we were when this all began 
 Guiding me from within 
 For I am just part of who I was back then 
 Where we were when this all began 
 For I am just part of who I was back then 
 Where we were when this all began 
 Something inside me 
 I cannot fix 
 So we begin 
 Begin again 
 So send me to my grave 
 Lives tremble on and on 
 I am afraid of becoming you 
 I'll deconstruct myself 
 For I am just a part of who I was 
 Where we were when this all began 
 But we are just a perception of a common theme 
 We are something more 
 I pretend I'm better, I disconnect 
 Searching and believing 
 That we are something more 
 I pretend I'm better, I disconnect
########### Nine Summers ###########
Misery, I wanted to forget you 
 But five years later I have grown 
 I have regret 
 You were better deserved, but we all learn 
 Hands to broken mirrors 
 We shattered our design 
 You were always so easy for me 
 To leave in ruins 
 Those nine summers we burned together 
 Were disparate and beautiful 
 Strange our thoughts can take us 
 And I can still feel the warmth 
 Coursing through my lungs 
 Escaping in my thoughts 
 Our hands to broken mirrors 
 We shattered 
 Those nine summers we burned together 
 Were disparate and beautiful 
 Strange our thoughts can take us 
 And I can still feel the warmth 
 Coursing through my lungs 
 Escaping in my thoughts 
 I hope that this letter finds you in drift 
 Provokes shared memories and you accept my apology 
 I was young and constantly desolate 
 A spinning picture of grey skies 
 I'm holding nothing back 
 My thoughts provoked this heart attack 
 And tonight I go on display to the world 
 But we silently know, this is between you and I 
 I hope this letter finds you in drift 
 I hope this finds you in drift
########### Virga ###########
We disappear from our thoughts and sounds 
 Our features, abrasive 
 So many things we overlook 
 Is there something that we don't know? 
 That over time. We're over time 
 Wrought with dysfunction, and callous minds 
 So take the knife within my heart 
 Sharpen it with water and virtue 
 Oh, the mystery 
 Of what we wished we knew 
 Oh, the misery 
 There's so much more that I could have 
 That I could give 
 Falling faster, gaining speed 
 Everything around me wraps me in light 
 Precious life 
 Something we seem to, to forget 
 I can feel something real burning inside 
 Something we seem to forget 
 I can feel it burning inside of me 
 Wind exerts my lungs 
 The influence of my being 
 Weightlessness, my loss 
 Weightlessness 
 A beautiful affection 
 Force its hold 
 Against my deep breath 
 Against my deep breath 
 Against my deep breath 
 Oh, the mystery 
 Of what we wished we knew 
 Oh, the misery 
 There's so much more that I could have 
 That I could give
########### Neo Seoul ###########
In the twisting, I see myself 
 Pixelated, construed, I am reaching out 
 For something, for me to hold on to 
 But I never do, failing, I never will 
 Some things just do not exist 
 And some days I'll be the evoked of 
 The hope for, for a landing, for a safety 
 But the synapse fires, exploding 
 And this is letting go 
 Life, this is a lesson that we don't sign up for 
 But we fatefully learn 
 And as I grow old 
 Time will break me apart 
 From stem to bough and my heart to reason 
 I will become the dirt of which I began 
 I will become the dirt of which I began 
 Distracted by imperfection 
 We are covered in rust 
 Hopeless and distant, hopeless and distant 
 We sway side to side 
 From season to season, we fall apart 
 So hold this in your hand and don't let go 
 These are the things that we live for 
 Some things, some things just do not exist 
 And some days, some days I'll be the evoked of 
 Dissonant, but we still try 
 Prudent through our brothers' eyes 
 Back at the start 
 We lost our direction 
 We are covered in rust 
 Hopeless and distant, we sway side to side 
 Distracted by imperfection 
 We fall, we fall apart
########### Parise ###########
Consign myself away 
 I've built myself with molten steel 
 My skeletal hands are wired and worn 
 I'm becoming a compound, I push and pull 
 Electric currents replace blood cells 
 Eccentric circuits, my soul connects 
 Spheric and strong 
 I no longer break down, I cannot rest 
 My eyes illuminate against the glass 
 Abstaining focal shifts to palindrome lines 
 Mimic expression, translucent model of progression 
 I look out, escape is granted, free myself? 
 No 
 Unresponsive, a mechanic I work inline 
 Scanning faces, I learn the nothingness inside 
 A binary heartbeat 
 A digital visionary 
 Escape is granted 
 And in this moment, I free myself 
 As each memory fades 
 In the emptiness, I free myself 
 Your hand reaches out 
 I am reaching back 
 Your hand reaches out 
 I am reaching back
########### A Wolf Amongst Ravens ###########
Where do we begin? 
 We are lost, we are polluted 
 We are lost, we are polluted 
 Where do we begin? 
 When everything is wrong we just forget 
 Move along and we play pretend 
 Surround your life with silver and gold 
 Your tinsel dreams to the make believe 
 Deconstructed and paralyzed so slowly 
 Some how I am evaporating 
 We dream to be the lesser 
 A malign separate existence 
 We belittle ourselves to a lesser 
 Being our dreams are not our dreams 
 Cogitation a distant fragment 
 Separate me from the whole 
 My thoughts are now unchained 
 And it seems that in everything we want 
 Isn't anything we need 
 And all the signals we seem to have taken for granted 
 We are lost, we are polluted 
 Into the grey, a wolf amongst ravens 
 Lines flicker and twist descending 
 A distorted creation from nothing 
 So monstrous, so murderous 
 Lay your body down and separate were shedding skin 
 Scale by scale the filth replaces it 
 You crystallize the world around you 
 You aim for the weak 
 A twisting sleep breaks inside of me 
 A sickness 
 You live in 
 I begin to break away 
 Please set me free 
 I will remain amongst the filth 
 Conceal my self in this residuum 
 I will remain amongst the filth 
 Asking,

 We are lost, we are polluted 
 We are lost, we are polluted

$$$$$$$$$$ uneven structure $$$$$$$$$$

########### Dianoia ###########
Ever smoldered splendor. 
 Never grieving pathos. 
 Being as the clean sword of... 
 righteousness. 
 Encompass the sibylline leaves. 
 The only truth starts in these ruins here. 
 An altered state of dianoia. 
 Auscultation of the inner grid of activity. 
 Proficient selfness won't cease.
########### Egocentric Focus ###########
With that egocentric focus. 
 The unending whirl of reflexive contemplation. 
 As the symbol of nothingness, drawing an 8. 
 Etching the message. Affecting the fluctuations. 
 Corrupted silence. Indecisive way of thinking. 
 Deactualising the essentiality of the self 
 provides the most erroneous forms of axioms. 
 Ubiquity of the nefarious behaviors 
 with the insane agreement of the perverted divinity.
########### To A Higher Quiddity ###########
Being tricked as a tool of anti-evolution. 
 A potent belief of being elysian. 
 Truthfulness is aura as manipulation belongs 
 to a higher quiddity.
########### Capillarity ###########
Going right away through the meaningless form of capillar structure tied to the fibers of used flesh. 
 It sinks into primordial synapses of the very essential part of the inextricable cage of emotions. 
 Ripping away the barrier. Delivering so much power 
 that ridiculous inert matter can not even exist - be animated. 
 Do these misaligned cells deserve the incandescent and necessary ray of life? 
 Realms of voltaic reactions bathe in the ultimate void. 
 Going right away through the meaningless form of capillar structure tied to the fibers of used flesh. 
 It sinks into primordial synapses of the very essential part of the inextricable cage of emotions. 
 An absence of life...
########### Confused Waveforms ###########
And absence of sense... 
 All is false - Everything is illusion. 
 To incur a constant, yet linear spurious waves of feeling. 
 Abnegation is the only way so all dreams looks true. 
 Reality is impulsion. Never being as it unconsistanly shows. 
 Fainting it all - Reality of confused waveforms. 
 Predefined as an altered model of chaos. 
 Undefined as a stream of energy. 
 That ridiculous inert matter can not even exist - be animated. 
 Does these misaligned cells deserve the incandescent and necessary ray of life? 
 Realms of voltaic reactions bathe in the ultimate void and absence of sense.
########### Delusions Of Grandeur ###########
Same patterns repeated. 
 A constant failure process. 
 The fables of fortune remain untold. 
 Delusions of grandeur is defeated 
 as nothingness takes control.
########### Depression ###########
Crave for the indecision. 
 Awaiting the ultimate answer. 
 Restless in infinite tediousness. 
 Verity uprises from Nihilant. 
 Womb of all ill shaped self reflections. 
 Imaging wrongness.
########### 8 ###########
[*scream*] 
 Entity made of torn codes, dripping sheds and forms of axioms. 
 Ever smouldered splendor. 
 Never grieving pathos. 
 Being harassed by pictorial lies. 
 (They fade back into thy own visions)
########### Awaken ###########
A dense, dull quiver can be felt from far away 
 Morsels whirls all around, melting down 
 An aberration into the womb breaks the microcosm 
 Aurora of a new abstract and elaborated macrocosm 
 This irrepressible fever plucks on stimulations 
 A dim halo appears at the heart of this randomness 
 Its bracing radiation projects patterns all over 
 The splendor conveys me into a boiling torrent 
 Freed from the womb, an overwhelming light surrounds everything 
 Expelled through this intense breach 
 A whole new set of perceptions gives warmth 
 The cosiness of gestation has come to an end 
 Genesis of a new cycle, the dawn of life 
 As this intimate alcove transforms into a peculiar place 
 A protective entourage builds up, fulfilling me with great motives 
 This thirst for the unkown goads me to leave my nymph 
 A will to fully value every portion of this vast realm 
 Precise shapes appears as the bewilderneness of the elements is lessened 
 Merely displaying the underlying fabric of the environment 
 And I open my eyes to see a
########### Frost ###########
...gray landscape filled with pitch black clouds 
 All heat has gone sensing frost 
 Frost, surrounding everything, freezing it 
 Trapped into thy consciousness 
 A flawless void pours into the indefinite shell 
 Extinguishing the inner discomfort, drowning it 
 And wiping the haze out of these glass bulwarks 
 Emptiness of Everything magnifies thy sensitivity 
 As the pain slowly resorbs and lets the channels free 
 Motionless ashes structures the horizon 
 Mentally building an uneven grid 
 Polygonal nests modeling brightless patterns 
 The only visible waypoints giving a comprehension 
 An understanding of the depth of this non energy 
 The subconscious strings can be felt now 
 Controlling the actions as a puppet master 
 This manikin state avoids me to make mistakes 
 Every little stimulation reproduces an ersatz of freewill 
 Informations runs through these freshly born pits of senses 
 The revigorating effect buries the verity of the context 
 Now the assimilation (is done), host of an education.
########### Hail ###########
Hail 
 Walls of rain washes out the innocence 
 The magnificent flood carves the letters down the flesh 
 Hierarchy slips into the felt strings - Alterating it all 
 Facing the preys as if they were real threats - Schism 
 Paranoid illusions leading to a higher step of evolution 
 A lull in the storm 
 Scattered clouds 
 At the break of the day 
 The allayer of fears 
 Dissipates the marks 
 Dries out the swamping lands 
 As water resorbs, ground can finally be seen 
 Very first sensation of en embodied existence 
 Fertility welcomes a higher comfort 
 An abode where experiences can melt.
########### Buds ###########
A stream, a motion 
 Lifting matter through the bonds 
 Sentience of knowledge 
 Healing the scars of innocence 
 I rationally straighten the surroundings, theorise the randomness 
 Scraping the  surface, infinite bandings are exposed 
 Hypnotised by the vertigiousness of things to come 
 I break the ropes of whiteness out and burst into buds 
 Getting closer to a well-defined path 
 A chess-like game where all pieces are mine 
 Buds, sprouts 
 Boundless in cognition 
 Escalating the tower of Babel 
 The coiled design mesmerises me 
 Am I taking this for the promised land? 
 Bemused by this opportunity 
 The fragile balance is lost 
 Too soon to dive in, too late to scarper 
 I glimpse the agressive vastness of this mental fluctuation 
 Essence is corrupted by vice emanating out of knowledge 
 And that unbeatable volition of tasting to ultimate perfection collapses 
 Magnifying the shadow of failure toward the ramparts of sageness 
 Now is the moment where my reign begins
########### Awe ###########
Unleashed, the components takes over everything with no consideration 
 The will to annihilate every element of this abhorrent scene becomes ripening 
 A fierce ocean spills toward this already botched up kingdom 
 It is now my turn to draw strings shackling this disgusting matrix 
 At the apex of the obelisk, order can be determined beyond one's sight 
 Escaping the uncertainness of these realms 
 A ceremony to seat the presidency of a now frigid blossom 
 Desire spouts down the surface 
 Eroding this illusion of wellness 
 Once taking one's lump through hail 
 I am now casting it back, hampering it all 
 Evoking awe
########### Quittance ###########
A regretful instant breaks 
 This is not the road leading to fullness 
 This is not what I wanted to reach 
 This is not the place I belong to 
 This is not where I was supposed to land 
 This is not the aim of this routine 
 This is not why I did build this 
 This is not a conclusion 
 This is not who I was meant to be 
 Why this discrepancy 
 A cause lost into fraudulent behaviors 
 Depicting a strong weakness of the self 
 All integrity shattered in million pieces 
 Mislead into temptation 
 This is not a denial, this is the true face of resentment 
 I demand redemption for all my transgressions 
 Prepared to strip myself down to the gist 
 A deafening silence slants over this desert 
 The burn of these distresses is extinct 
 I feel now freed from that perturbed shallowness 
 Ready to take one last impulse and lift off 
 I am aloud in the escape 
 Allowed to leave this place.
########### Plenitude ###########
No longer connected to the ground, 
 The ultimate ascension is triggered. 
 No longer obstructed from my condition, 
 Everything is revealed. 
 Curves crossing and dead ends are all past. 
 The vivid chunk is standing out in front of me. 
 Still out of reach it irradiates my essence. 
 Last breath before air turns into light. 
 The dim contrast of the experience vanishes. 
 Colorless patterns are filled with a permanent brightness. 
 The convergence of every challenges and disillusions 
 Spurs me beyond the very state of grace. 
 A measureless momentum where matter and mind 
 Collapses together to commute into Plenitude.

########### Departure ###########
This time, we'll reach for the sky. 
 Our lives will be our safe place 
 where every instant of love will be with me, 
 forever with me. 
 Every memory ends with me, it can't be forgotten. 
 We've been waiting for everything, 
 and it stays with me, makes me feel anything. 
 One day we'll rest our heads, and you will see.
########### Transitions ###########
Life can be anything we want it to be, get the walls. 
 We can not look back, but think about. 
 They can't stop us now, from our thoughts 
 and our dreams with the visions of liberty. 
 For all those sleepless nights, 
 in arms you can't reach, we'll fall. 
 We are shaping; we are taking everything to the ground. 
 You can't save us from ourselves, 
 you can't even save yourselves. 
 You can't stop us from our thoughts, 
 our visions of a better world. 
 But now take it this way, 
 you can't stop me now. 
 Everything is lost so prepare yourself when the end is here. 
 Remember, the world can't be forgotten. 
 We're busy shaping a new world. 
 You can't save us from ourselves, 
 you can't stop us from our thoughts and dreams, 
 our visions of fucking apathy, 
 for all those sleepless nights, 
 we're falling down again. 
 These transitions in reverie could never be what you wanted them to be, 
 it's what I believe. 
 These sleepless nights in arms you can't reach 
 will never be what you thought they would be. 
 I can't sleep, I can't breath. 
 I can't breathe the air that you breathe, 
 I can't be the dreams that you dream. 
 You're taking your time, 
 and I can't breathe the air. 
 I can't breath the air that you breathe, 
 I can't be the dreams that you dream. 
 Living life in reverie could never be what you fucking thought it would be
########### Encounter... ###########
Our lives are nothing but a means to an end. 
 And when the ground cracks beneath your feet, 
 You will find the only thing that's left is peace of mind, 
 Or any other fucking kind. 
 I've been reciting this with an imminent gaze, 
 And now I don't know if you've got it in you but, 
 life will be the fucking death of me. 
 This is all just a repetition. 
 To everyone, make it a mission to be the change you want to see. 
 Lay down the foundation and where you wish to be. 
 I promise that it won't be the place you'll find me. 
 Get ready for the calm, before the storm. 
 These are the words that we speak, 
 But have you seen the things that we've been seeing? 
 Buried beneath the walls, get ready for the calm I say. 
 Have you seen what I've been, 
 Waiting for the passage our light brings? 
 Have you seen what I've seen? 
 Get ready, buried beneath the walls. 
 Today resigns the peace through our decisions. 
 This is a calling to arms; 
 We cannot face our decisions in favor of you. 
 Don't you think it's time to go home? 
 You're always running from it. 
 This is what it feels to be torn, 
 But death will beat you to it. 
 Don't you think it's time to go home? 
 This is what it feels to be torn and this is what it is. 
 I bet you never saw this coming.
########### In Pursuit Of ###########
To amount for the travelled skies, 
 I'm seeing picture perfect lines. 
 Now breathe in the masses, a carrier in our feat of tired dreams. 
 Gravity holds us to a stand still. 
 Look for the better signs; 
 we're all in pursuit of this time. 
 It's all laid out right in front of me, 
 looking back into absence. 
 And I'll stop running from what never chases me, 
 when you keep your hands where everyone can see. 
 What's become of this place we once loved? 
 They said it was coming. 
 Oh fuck, this is just my luck. 
 We've all paid the fucking price. 
 They said it was coming, 
 oh my god, now here it comes. 
 Tides never brought the change we all thought that they would bring. 
 Now set the sky aflame. 
 So tell me, are you gonna make a decision that you'll regret years from now? 
 When you keep your hands where everyone can see 
 but what's become of this place we once loved. 
 You can back into absence. 
 So bite your fucking tongue, 
 cause your out of control this time. 
 Now let me teach you a thing or two about life. 
 We've all paid the fucking price. 
 What's become of this place we once loved? 
 What has happened to this place that we once loved? 
 Now here it comes...
########### Still Waters ###########
Now climbing mountains on the verge of the fall, 
 but looking backwards in time, 
 I could feel the walls about to break. 
 And losing devotion in time has meant there will be nothing left for me. 
 We are the solution. 
 Breathe, breathe in the bright, 
 breathe in the sight. 
 Breathe in, it's all around you. 
 Breathe, breathe in the sight, 
 breathe in the bright. 
 Prove that it's all around you. 
 We are the creation. 
 We are the solution to all. 
 And this indifference won't mean a fucking thing, 
 because I am everywhere. 
 You thought you could survive this but now you've lost all motion. 
 Take this place, rip down the walls and make it yours. 
 I am the storm and here we go again. 
 Breaking down, I swear I'll tear you apart. 
 This indifference won't mean a fucking thing; 
 this is all just a feeble attempt at the sound. 
 Oh, haven't you heard that it's all just a matter of time? 
 Have I lost all faith in my mind? 
 No I told you, I told you, I told you a thousand times. 
 I told you a thousand times. 
 Never lay your dreams aside; 
 we've been losing the light. 
 Carried along still waters, 
 we're always losing our place in time. 
 This is all just a feeble attempt at the sound, 
 I've told you a thousand times. 
 Losing devotion in time, it's taking over our lives. 
 Breaking down, it's all just a matter of time. 
 It's just a matter of time.
########### At Last ###########
And if you thought it was over then you better think twice. 
 You've been given your last chance, now face the fucking avalanche. 
 And who the fuck are you to say that we're just wasting time? 
 There's no need to look back as we approach the finish line. 
 Can't stand side by side if you can't face the fucking avalanche. 
 We're standing on top at last. 
 At last, you'll have to face the fucking avalanche. 
 Standing at the top of the world. 
 At last, looking down from the top of the world. 
 At last we feel alive.
########### Hydroplaning ###########
We are all inclinded to live a separate way of life. 
 Some say it's our downfall, 
 But there are reasons why we tread on different sides. 
 And some say it's our downfall if we don't keep to the right, 
 Always keep gold in our sights. 
 Looking further into such things, there is no, there is no balance worth letting go. 
 We can tell that you're trying to swing at something you can't hit. 
 The wind won't blow you back on your feet when you're stuck on repeat. 
 So here, so here I stand, perfectly aligned with the, with the other side. 
 We can tell that you're trying to swing at something you can't hit. x2 
 It's all coming to a much needed end. 
 What the fuck's with all the shit that you've been force feeding down the throats of others, 
 Underneath the fucking covers, thinking that we wouldn't know. 
 Why do you try to live a worthless way of life? 
 I've tried to explain to you a half a dozen times. 
 I've lied to you kindly half the time. 
 There is no reason to let ourselves go, 
 Pushing forward just to stay afloat. 
 Try to stay afloat. 
 We can tell that you're trying to swing at something you can't hit. 
 The wind won't blow you back on your feet when you're stuck on repeat. 
 Some say it's our downfall if we don't keep to the right. 
 We can tell that you're trying to swing at something you can't hit, 
 And it's coming to a much needed end. 
 And we'll never follow you because the road signs point us in the right direction. 
 Our sights will never align. 
 And we'll never follow you because the road signs point us in the right direction. 
 Our sights will never, will never align.
########### Paralyzed ###########
How does it feel to be on the top of the world? 
 It's not like your stage is any higher, any louder. 
 You're still only 10 feet above flat ground. 
 Hell, I don't want to, but I'll give it to you. 
 Every face down there wants you. 
 Although, they'll turn at the drop of a dime. 
 Like wild dogs we're all waiting in line, 
 For you to fuck up hard enough, so we can push you aside. 
 We've learned there's more to music than sound. 
 And if you're listening, I hope you know we built this up from the ground. 
 Every remark with heart. 
 We're not saints, but at least we're not fake. 
 And if you're listening, then put your hands up in the air and sing: 
 We're not afraid to finally speak our minds. 
 We're not afraid and we're no longer blind. 
 We're not afraid to leave your bullshit scene behind. 
 We're not afraid, we're not afraid this time, oh! 
 Train wrecks develop so slowly, 
 And in due time this life will fill your heart with hate. 
 In due time, life will reject your advances. 
 We'll attempt to put the world on its axis, oh! 
 We don't know who you are right now. 
 Hey now, this ain't about you, 
 But everything relies on first impressions. 
 So when the most we know was just your shitty town and your shitty friends. 
 To simplify it, you're so irrelevant. 
 I'll say you're not worth shit, although the world's a market for it. 
 I just hope they see the problem with this. 
 I'll bite my tongue, this system is corrupt. 
 So we'll just shake it off, and continue being underdogs. 
 You're all so god damn easily impressed. x3 
 We don't know who you are right now. 
 Hey now, this ain't about you, 
 But everything relies on first impressions. 
 So when the most we know was just your bad tattoos, trends, 
 And underdeveloped pen stains you scribble to shit friends. 
 I'll say you're not worth shit, although the world's a market for it. 
 I hope that they see the problem.
########### Clockwork ###########
It happens everytime, we emphasize, 
 "Don't let this time pass you by." 
 God damn everyone in this fucking place. 
 We tried to care, but you were never there on time. 
 Keep that in mind when you're running circles left and right. 
 God damn everyone in this place, because I hate everything. 
 I've been face-to-face with the times. 
 Good luck to everyone in this fucking place, 
 And god damn everyone in this fucked up place. 
 God damn everyone in this place, because I hate everything. 
 I've been dying to hear your thoughts on our infatuation with sound. 
 If you see it as a burden then sit the fuck down. 
 So set the stopwatch to the beat of your dead heart, 
 And watch us run right past you. 
 You know we'll outlast you, because we're always fucking first place. 
 Well you might as well spit in my fucking face. 
 It's insulting enough you couldn't trust us. 
 You still stutter when we're face to face or alone. 
 We're always fucking first place. 
 How does it feel to stare at each falling grain of sand? 
 How does it feel to count them down all by yourself? 
 We tried to reset the clocks, so you can fuck yourself.
########### Relapse; Signs. ###########
When I awoke in a pool of sweat, 
 Not a thought crossed my mind that I was reading the wrong signs. 
 This all so meaningless to me, and as endless as it seems, 
 I've been turning the other cheek to the thoughts that left me feeling weak. 
 Every time this happens to me, I find more than good reason in speaking slowly. 
 Yet I refuse to believe that the truth is a life. 
 I'm at fault for the decisions I have made. 
 I'm falling asleep. 
 I swear I've seen this a thousand times before. 
 It's like a metaphor that I can't ignore, anymore. 
 This is the last time I remember crawling on my knees in desperation. 
 I'm falling asleep again. 
 Why can't I wake up? Time to wake up. 
 Pretend everything's fine. 
 Relapse, one more fucking time. 
 The grass is greener on the other side. 
 All the time spent backbeddling seems useless, 
 Because you never really get back what you've lost. 
 But I've spent my life at the edge of the clouds, 
 Obsessed with the sound, I'll never look down. 
 Why can't I wake up? Time to wake up. 
 Pretend, everything's fine. 
 Relapse. 
 Dear dreamer, did you ever think to cover your tracks? 
 Keep light on the footsteps. 
 Cause if the shoe fits, well the fucking shoe fits. 
 Come to peace with it and you'll breathe. 
 Sanity, it never Seems to come easily to me. 
 Dear dreamer, it's not my fault your life's a fucking nightmare. 
 It'll slip right through your hands. 
 Dear dreamer, it's time you rub your eyes and look at your sad reality.
########### Tunnel Vision ###########
Day one: picked apart myself. 
 Lost in translation, I've stumbled on the misfortunes of life. 
 We are the fallen. We are the fractured skies. 
 We are the living nightmare and we can't open our eyes. 
 So clap your hands to the beat of the drum, 
 If you think that some days never end. 
 Give in, understand this: 
 If we're the only living thing in the world, 
 Your narrow mind can't wage war on what's left now, looking away. 
 So careless, and self taught, not selfless. 
 "Explain." 
 What!? 
 "Your Thought process." 
 I shouldn't listen to this! 
 "When did you become so arrogant?" 
 It's my choice for once. 
 Inhale the words you never thought you could handle. 
 Cold hands won't hold open the door for your eyes, 
 And tell you you're missing a substance. 
 In fact it's the only thing crossing your mind. 
 You're fucked in the head. 
 We're all fucked in the end. 
 Day two: read over my notes. 
 I packed a map to skip the fault lines in the road. 
 But when it ends, I've still got nowhere to go. 
 We are the fallen.  We are the fractured skies. 
 We are the living nightmare and we can't open our eyes. 
 We're not the only living thing in the world. 
 Open your eyes.
########### I.N.T.E.N.T ###########
Lately, I've been focused so plainly on the process of moving forward, 
 How life was never easy, how we're alone through it, 
 Just like how we're alone and this time we spend retreating back to our heads. 
 For the greater good we were broken down. 
 If you only have a few words make them count. 
 I know that it's hard to grasp, but I won't let go. 
 We've learned our role in the earth's tilt, 
 We try to find some meaning left in sound. 
 They say that home is where you make it, 
 But home's a sad story when you're always alone. 
 I'm not your fucking shoulder to cry on. 
 I'm not the one you fucking rely on. 
 It's so sad you'll die alone. 
 I can see how the past holds meaning, 
 But it's still out of reach and that's a simple fact. 
 Second guessing yourself has never come so easily. 
 It's not worth it, move forward, forward this time. It's not worth it. 
 Lately, I've found my lungs to be heavy, stopping me from moving forward. 
 They never said it was easy, I hear them now. 
 It's like we're all alone in this time we spend retreating back to our heads. 
 It's all useless if we can't make you see some sort of meaning. 
 This was always our intent. x3 
 Can you hear us now? x3 
 This was always our intention. 
 For the greater good we're all broken down, in one way or another. 
 Can you hear us now? 
 And to those who weren't, well I'll wish you were. 
 It's so hard, yet so important, not to live so securely. 
 Loss finds nothing but meaning. 
 Lately, I've been focused so plainly. 
 Lately, it's hard to keep believing, 
 But maybe we're not alone in it and maybe we weren't broken down in the first place.

########### / (Divided By) ###########
Our lives don't look so discouraging, 
 But the view gets worse without the ties that keep one sane. 
 Just a few days drive away and if they back out now they weren't there to begin with. 
 It's amazing how much people change. 
 You can think what you want but we're always gonna be the same. 
 We'll never apologize, cause you were never on our side. 
 How can you all look at me the same way? 
 It's safe to say your hearts are in the wrong place. 
 Let's be honest, cause honestly, not everything is so damn hard to believe. 
 So stop talking, your words just get in the way. 
 Your hearts are in the wrong place. 
 Trust me when I say, we don't miss the constant bullshit you left at our doorstep, 
 Or the lack of scenery. I guess life built us differently. 
 How can you all look at me the same way? 
 Your hearts are in the wrong place. 
 So while wandering through the labyrinth in my head, 
 I found peace of mind in giving up on all the ones who left. 
 And we won't miss the arguments, we won't miss the constant stress. 
 We won't miss the constant bullshit you left at our doorstep. 
 We're the ones you love to hate, 
 We're the ones who stay awake and treat themselves so commonly, 
 To the smoke and the scenery. 
 And you'll never escape. 
 You'll never escape burning bridges, digging your own grave. 
 And you'll never escape, you'll never escape. 
 Your hearts are in the wrong place. 
 Shut up, we still don't give a fuck; no one ever did. 
 We've grown so sick of it. 
 What have you done with your life? 
 Still can't contend with this. 
 Good luck champ, go break a fucking leg.

 You tread so lightly on a line in the sand and if you can't decide then you're already gone / 
 I am the cure / 
 Where in this moment, all your dreams are certainties / 
 What you say is so discerning I just wish I was dead / 
 But I'll never experience the emotion that comes with a separation from the head, to the spirit of the body / 
 I can't speak / 
 I can't breathe / 
 But in this moment, my mind is an ocean waiting for the calm before this storm / 
 "You wanna do it again?" / 
 You like the taste of fire burning through like cancer? / 
 What ever you desire... Acquire it! / 
 I told you the world is yours to keep, as long as you're still sleeping / 
 But I am the cure, I am the remedy / 
 You left me here again / 
 Dependance is a friend / 
 Alone until the end / 
 Dependance is a friend, so take your leave and go / 
 Can we just let it go? / 
 Can we just let it all go? / 
 Cause we forget the words we said / 
 This picture was worth a thousand memories before you smudged our faces / 
 Our minds erasing, before our eyes / 
 Our minds erasing, before our eyes / 
 I told you the world is yours to keep, as long as you're still sleeping / 
 But I am the cure, I am the remedy / 
 You left me here again / 
 Dependance is a friend / 
 Alone until the end / 
 Dependance is a friend, so take your leave and go

########### Entry Level Exit Wounds ###########
Dirty habits and dirty lives. 
 She can't hold back. 
 She must fulfill her end of the addiction. 
 Hunting, sweating, freezing. 
 Just another day in the life of a dead girl. 
 She can't live without her shit. 
 Rock bottom is just around the corner, and she has a first class ticket. 
 Test the vein, prep it... 
 Tie the knot, make the blood clot... 
 Needle in. "oh, what sin!", they all say. 
 Just wait there's more. 
 More from this whore? 
 Oh yes there is... 
 She ruined her kids. 
 In a world that few can understand, she's full of fucking pity. 
 This life is not worth living. 
 Who's she kidding? 
 Now she has entry level exit wounds. 
 Her face is missing.
########### Your World Of Lies ###########
Stuck in your world of make believe, it is you who fails 
 You seek guidance from all the wrong places 
 You let the words on a page dictate your life 
 You are so blinded by these lies that you never take the time to figure out who you truly are 
 I will never be one of those misguided fools 
 His blood was shed? 
 Supposedly for the sake of mankind 
 Its time to open your ears to the truth 
 His blood was shed? (x2) 
 It's nothing but a fairy tale 
 Some ink on a page, some ink on a page 
 I know the truth 
 So close that book, so close that book 
 Never again 
 Get caught in the story 
 Never again 
 I will never be one of those misguided fools 
 But your world of lies is your home 
 We are on our own (x2) 
 I make my own choice 
 No one is taking credit for my story 
 The masses are blind 
 Blinded by faith, leading them on 
 No one controls my destiny 
 No one, no one but me 
 I know the truth, we are on our own
########### Mark My Words ###########
You are the destroyer of one of the only things that I value and hold close to my heart 
 Now you have taken my life, and you have taken my soul 
 But times have changed 
 You are dead to me 
 I am no longer your torture victim 
 I'm fed up with your fucking lies and games 
 The tables have turned and I shall have my way 
 This is a new beginning in every way 
 You and I are a shadow of the past 
 You've wasted so much of my life and I will never get it back 
 No more will you haunt my life 
 Mark my words, you were nothing more than a mistake 
 No more, I am looking past 
 Past you 
 I am now a stronger person because of this, not because of you 
 Mark my words, you are done 
 Mark my words, you are death 
 I am now a stronger person because of this 
 Mark my words, you are done 
 Mark my words, you are death
########### All Things Set Aside ###########
When all their backs have turned, the worst is now much worse. 
 The act of being weeded out, no one to turn to. 
 You must fight on. Spill blood. This is now a fight. 
 You must fight on. Spill blood. This is now a fight to the end. 
 Leave no one alive. No excuses. They gave this a start, and we are giving it an end. 
 Bring forth your tortured. Bring forth you and I. 
 No remorse. 
 In our hearts and our minds. 
 These are all things set aside. (x2) 
 In our hearts and our minds, there is a poison that weakens their veins. No trust. 
 When all hope is lost, we will stand. Heads held high. 
 All things set aside. (x2) 
 They are the poison.
########### Indefinite Bloodlust ###########
We all have a craving for destruction 
 It's another piece of who we are 
 Why deny these blood filled urges 
 They egg it on 
 We lust for blood 
 To lust for blood is to refuse who we are 
 We need to think about what we are 
 What we are 
 We are beings, violent minded 
 Yet they think us to be blind 
 We are the hope for a better tomorrow 
 a.k.a yesterdays unattended funerals 
 They take away our blades but ask us to decipate 
 This is not how it's supposed to be 
 Killing is killing, no matter how the line goes flat 
 Reach out, grab your victim 
 Place the blade on his vein 
 Don't mind the memories spilling across your fingers 
 Just close your eyes and do as your told 
 They say we benefit from this but we feel more raped than anything 
 They'll tease us with sex 
 Blind us from gore yet ask us to kill 
 Fuck you 
 We'll see what we want to see 
 You kill if you want to kill 
 This is indefinite bloodlust
########### Sever The Voices ###########
We all know what lies behind the walls of deceit. 
 These are the thoughts that keep him awake. 
 He contemplates his fate. 
 He has to decide what it is he truely wants. 
 An hour of pleasure, or two ruined lives? 
 He has to decide. 
 He cant sever the voices, from his mind. 
 The Time......is now. 
 What is his choice, not what is his fate. 
 To destroy all that is beautiful in not only his life, 
 but hers too? 
 Seperate the time and place, he has come to the end. 
 He holds onto false ideas of what makes a man. 
 He thinks no more about the love of another, 
 he chooses to only satisfy himself. 
 Selfishness is not the word. 
 He has chosen, but he knows this is wrong. 
 He inserts........death for lust. 
 She grieves. 
 He knows better but chooses his path 
 and now he must live with this. 
 She walks in, face like death. 
 She puts her hands around his weak and sweaty neck. 
 He's turned cold blue now. 
 There is blood and there's tears, for this occasion. 
 She can't sever the voices from her mind. 
 They held each other down
########### The Black Funeral March ###########
Cringing at the thought of dealing with your loss 
 With each new day leading to more devastation 
 Waiting for the call "I'm sorry...he's gone" 
 All that seems to be is suffering 
 Weeping, frustration, maybe denial 
 Shopping for caskets 
 Void of real life when you're losing another's 
 Bow your head and clear your thoughts 
 This will be a funeral march 
 Void of real life when losing another's 
 Victim to a heinous crime 
 Why him? Torture. Bloodshed. 
 Why him? People are sick and that wont change 
 Revolting actions lead to this pain 
 But to overcome a pain so fierce? 
 How does one continue on in life? 
 One just does, simply does 
 Nothing can pay back the price of a life 
 This is a black funeral march 
 This isn't the end
########### Crawl Back ###########
I will be known 
 and I will scream it 
 I will be known today 
 Relayed into thoughts of tranquil society, as this is 
 Our last nights rest 
 I will be known 
 and i will scream it 
 I will be known today 
 If these are all the wounds that we suffer, then we 
 are the lucky ones (2X) 
 If this is all the time we have then we must move 
 forward 
 I can't be your only savior 
 this will break 
 under the pressure of their eyes 
 I can't feel guilt I cant feel shit (2X) 
 I cant feel shit 
 I can't feel guilt I cant feel shit 
 Do I need to repeat myself? 
 You cant crawl back 
 Cant crawl towards the light (2X) 
 I am now numb...
########### Mark The Lines ###########
Lost in the woods of a dream 
 Call it an American one 
 But we couldn't be further from home. 
 So we rode, in the search of a place 
 To rest our bloodshot eyes 
 But everything has a price to pay, 
 Everything has a price to pay. 
 In the face of a stranger 
 There was some sympathy to be found 
 So we'll draw the innocence 
 Don't make me regret this 
 Mark the line, 
 Right now. 
 Mark the fucking lines, 
 We have been double crossed 
 Let the pain begin 
 Mark the lines 
 What's done is done 
 Everything has a price to pay don't make me regret. 
 This was never the way, still no answer 
 Will you stand by me when I collapse?
########### It's Not Safe To Swim Today ###########
I knew this would be hell, 
 But this is not living 
 Push them down and exhale water 
 Push them down and exhale blood x2 
 Breathe 
 You wanted this 
 And if we can't even trust ourselves 
 How can we trust anyone else 
 It's not safe to swim today, 
 It's not safe... 
 I don't think I can be saved 
 This shallow water is my grave
########### Pillars ###########
(Instrumental)
########### We Bow In It's Aura ###########
Triumphant beyond its glory 
 Like a towering prize, they stand proud 
 From their hands, a demonic entity, as it comes to life 
 The electric playground breathes irradiant light from... 
 Muses the eyes of the faithful with a single touch 
 The electric playground muses the eyes of the faithful with a single touch 
 Cauterization envelops your soul as all joy drains from your body 
 Knees collapsing, you bow in its aura 
 In the crowd, a head gives the word 
 With a blue glow, the playground comes to life 
 Unveiling the secret in us all 
 Knees collapsing, we bow in its aura
########### All Eyes Look Ahead ###########
Chariots ride above fiery craters 
 Uncertain a mist appears ahead 
 Solvent and simple the figure approaches 
 Stench of the dead stings my nostrils, the sulky 
 Figure whispers to me 
 Ultimate sacrifice or be condemned 
 I raise to my knees cutting his work in two 
 Life and death so simply put 
 I wrap my hands around his cold shape, I wrap my 
 fucking hands 
 Screaming till my lungs bleed I clench 
 Screaming till my lungs bleed I end this
########### It's Torn Away ###########
This is the last time I will struggle 
 The eyes of a million 
 Follow each step i take walking further into hell 
 The weak and willing wither under the weight of their own restraint 
 We hold an ideal of the way it's supposed to be 
 Every motion creates a canyon left empty 
 Slowly the path begins to crumble and split 
 Destruction lurks waiting to fill the void 
 While the other motions grief and iridescent light 
 A sense of knowing and divide 
 This is a choice in which we all relate 
 This is a choice make up your mind 
 Following step by step in each of our lives 
 Eyes always following and watching 
 Speaking tongues unknown 
 Following step by step I go 
 It's torn away when I try to hold on 
 I grab the end of my senses, dragging them to reality 
 And as I see who I am now this is the path to being free 
 This is the last time I will struggle 
 The eyes of a million follow each step 
 I take walking further into hell 
 The weak and willing wither under the weight 
 We hold an ideal of the way it's supposed to be 
 Seemingly perfect like a grid composed of dots 
 Following step by step in each of our lives 
 Eyes always following and watching speaking tongues unknown 
 following step by step I go
########### Unbreakable ###########
I hear them calling, the damned are calling 
 From this hell on earth 
 Their voices flooding my ears, 
 I hear them calling 
 From this hell on earth 
 I sit back watching above, 
 sacrifice would mean relief from these times 
 We all hold the power to trust and have faith in ourselves 
 But just like a coward we flee from our hearts 
 Now is the time to believe in yourself 
 Have no fear how others think of you or will judge you 
 Because your greatness will silence them all 
 Unbreakable 
 Now is the time to believe 
 Now is the time to believe in yourself 
 Together, unbreakable, immortal
########### Dark Passenger ###########
I am in control 
 Judgment time has come 
 This world is mine, I'll mold it with my hands 
 Two trails lay before me, I know one as familiar as my senses 
 The other one preaches pain upon my mind, my eyesight extends 
 In my sights I have nothing, but guilt and deceit 
 They lay before me begging and willing for eternal mercy on their lives 
 Now's my time, this life is mine to make, complete 
 This choice is mine to take, receive
########### The Higler ###########
I have come to bear the worlds burden 
 A selfish unholy command 
 Calling towards the stars, an essential flow of blood 
 So they've come to take our pride 
 We will overcome their lie 
 I will stand and fight 
 Grazing the pastures of the restless ones 
 They command dominance in all, a force to obey 
 Never 
 My brain unravels at my feet 
 Spilling what I know in defeat 
 My unconscious try is failing 
 Our existence in the fold 
 Demanding focus the internal message repeats 
 A mask to a septic being 
 Calling towards the stars, essential flow of blood 
 Essential to us all
########### Resistance ###########
From the beginning a novel sworn in romance 
 A display of two statuses revealed 
 We cast it all hoping for a bit of desire 
 Swept underneath our emotions burden inside 
 We find ourselves searching, hoping, 
 For a muse in the night to bring relief 
 An endless search for some a masked silhouette 
 Dancing in shadows our greatest fears 
 Resistance to desire 
 Swept underneath our emotions burden inside 
 We find ourselves searching, hoping, 
 For a muse in the night to bring relief 
 Colliding within we torch ourselves 
 A full flowing chalice of apathy 
 We know that this is the end our past a kindled undying flare 
 We cast it all hoping for a bit of desire 
 Swept underneath our emotions we find ourselves
########### Mowgli ###########
You hold the key to my casket 
 No more questions, just the thought of fulfillment 
 Sleep burns my eyes 
 Now forced to grasp a world of infinity 
 The notion is revealed 
 Swimming in my mind my callus shell 
 A reminder of what I've become 
 Transferring our thoughts into one
########### Namaste ###########
We will stand, make this place our own 
 One day we will leave it behind 
 We will stand, make this place our own 
 And one day leave it all behind 
 There is a place 
 An isle of non-existence created by our drive to live 
 Somewhere other than reality 
 We must sacrifice to survive, others try to take and deprive 
 Live together, die alone 
 Created by our drive to live 
 Fight on until it's known, our purpose, our being here 
 Must be a sign to the path, to the path we must take 
 From the sky a black smoke engulfs our minds, our souls 
 We fight on until it is known, our purpose 
 This is the path 
 The path we must take 
 We will stand make this place our own 
 One day we will leave it behind 
 We will stand, make this place our own 
 And one day leave it all behind
########### Conquer ###########
My eyes, my eyes have failed me 
 A passenger in infinite great wisdom 
 We all struggle to possess the key to our lives 
 We ignite, we ignite, shedding new light 
 Overcoming what we were left with 
 Conquering the motionless satellites 
 In my future blank canvas full of design 
 Never searching we search for ourselves 
 My face has seen all walks of the earth 
 When there's nothing we fall apart 
 We fall to our knees, collecting our thoughts 
 They can't know this 
 The thickened air surrounds us 
 Clenching at our lungs 
 Searching blindly I follow a prophets sense of one 
 My eyes have failed me tonight 
 Conquer
########### Codex ###########
Imprisoned in all of us, a journey 
 A true test of being, a struggle in us all to be human 
 We all possess the most raw and natural power deep inside 
 Standing there in the moment 
 In the position to live now 
 Temptation won't control me 
 In the position to live now 
 We all know there is something more to our lives 
 When the inner core beckons 
 Savage and clean the body still receiving, a message 
 The code to greatness 
 A known true cure to us all
########### Divide Paths ###########
Raise your fist 
 Smell the air 
 Taste the fame 
 We follow our hearts for 
 This time is fading 
 We nurture our minds 
 With a fake lullaby 
 In this world 
 Each to their own 
 Divided Paths 
 In Overcoming false hopes, 
 We enter the age of cycles 
 Freely we take to the air 
 Not knowing nor- 
 Caring the end 
 I won't forget today 
 It is burned inside 
 My Brain 
 We use memories to 
 Canvas our lives in 
 Colored means 
 This is all our 
 Destiny 
 In This world.
########### Punisher ###########
Do you remember 
 When your heart had that 
 Drive, Thrived to seek more 
 While it was there 
 The last care 
 We won't sleep for a day 
 If we survive, survive 
 Just one more day. 
 I'll forge a moment 
 A Marvel for all of 
 Time in life was simple 
 Mended by the mask, 
 Perfection glistens 
 It glows glamorous 
 Faces drawing near 
 Purged away by the 
 Flame seeking out 
 Crystals 
 Under this weight 
 We crawl 
 Last shot trigger 
 Stall 
 Hold your ground 
 Freeze all of your love 
 Ignite all the lust 
 As we try to get back 
 It drifts away.
########### Winter Is Coming Soon ###########
This is our kin, 
 Our oath, and 
 Our Honor 
 Within my chest beats 
 The heart of a lion 
 Winter is coming soon 
 The white wall 
 We are the left behind 
 The lost who never glance 
 Behind 
 For everything we 
 Need is in our minds 
 We save the broken ones 
 The helpless left with 
 No defense 
 Ones left standing in 
 The dust and grime 
 A Virus 
 Stay true to yourself, 
 So much value in that line 
 Race to the top 
 There we can see to no 
 Measure 
 Look for your power 
 Everlasting, raging 
 Inside 
 Look for your power 
 Master and conquer 
 Till you expire.
########### The Glass Slide ###########
Calibrate 
 Feel the vibrations 
 Lasso them 
 Hold on for the ride 
 Despair inside calls to you 
 Uprise inside calls to you 
 Cowards will call for 
 Design 
 I'll light the match 
 Can you take me down? 
 Ignite the fuse 
 Can you take me down? 
 Relay the message 
 Ravage your false goodbyes 
 Command yourself into 
 Twisted figurines 
 I see poems of rise 
 They know I live 
 Upon the glass slide 
 I know the truth 
 It's still denying me 
 I know the truth 
 It haunts me 
 They know I 
 Live upon the 
 Glass slide 
 Now test yourself 
 Challange it 
 Now test yourself 
 A failure of diamond design 
 Now test yourself 
 A breeding of 
 Under-archived.
########### Enter My Dreams ###########
We are the start of bleeding 
 Fascination 
 Slowly envelop what we 
 Thrive 
 Lacerate, fill your lungs with 
 Passion 
 Intentions last play at crime 
 Enter my dreams 
 No pictures or inquries 
 They enter to feast on the 
 Fearsome 
 The devil's kind is right 
 Enter my dreams 
 No pictures or inquries 
 My thoughts are 
 Not a straight line 
 They fluctuate like 
 Waves or wine 
 I will not falter 
 I will unbind 
 If you feel satisfied 
 Then exit now 
 'Cause in this nature 
 Hunger will thrive 
 Here it's the last 
 One, so say goodbye 
 Feel the songs serenade 
 Spun in it's twine 
 I will not falter 
 I will unbind 
 Song's serenade 
 Spun in it's twine 
 Enter my dreams 
 No pictures or inquries 
 My thoughts are not a 
 Straight line - They 
 Fluctuate to a 
 Rhyme.
########### Numerical Scheme ###########
Pictures graze my 
 Consciousness like a 
 Trainwreck 
 Unforeseen 
 Ripped from the hands of 
 The beast and given away 
 To those who conquer 
 Blood and sand - the only 
 Thoughts upon my mind 
 A numerical scheme 
 An unbearable dream 
 We stand at the line and 
 Leap towards our fears 
 And in this boundless 
 Moment 
 We Fall 
 We stand at the line and 
 Leap towards our fears 
 We mold our destiny 
 Through the actions of 
 Our Lives.
########### Vicious Circles ###########
Messenger, when have you seen my face ? 
 I will become, become like the wind 
 A tyrant in disguise 
 A muse upon our eyes 
 A rare extermination, non stop till extinction 
 When have you seen my face ? 
 I will reform, reform like the storm 
 No stop to my spreading 
 Unarmed die around me 
 Enter vicious circles 
 Feel it close upon you 
 You feel it consume us all, us 
 Our honor is out the window for tonight 
 Choke on leverage 
 You feel it consume us all,ours 
 Our honor is out the window for tonight 
 For tonight 
 For tonight 
 When have you seen my face ? 
 I will become - become like the stone 
 So strong to my standings 
 My skin cold and lonely 
 Feelings will mean nothing 
 I laugh at their coming 
 I'd taunt what they'd die for 
 I'd taunt what they'd die for 
 When you find yourself in that room not alone 
 You are surrounded 
 You will collide with your thoughts 
 Brand yourself a natural inside you know it (X2) 
 No one will save you today 
 This is a fight for your pride (X2)
########### With Passion And Power ###########
This is a war 
 And attack on us all 
 We all let it slide as our 
 Morals burn in it's wake 
 We all fly 
 Until the day that it strikes you. 
 Leaves you broken inside 
 How could this be 
 Happening? We were like 
 Brothers 
 I won't forget you 
 Keep you with me 
 When the smoke clears 
 Our life's total appears 
 We will map everything, 
 Structure all of the Lines 
 When the smoke clears 
 Our life's total appears 
 You were a king to us all, 
 Gentle giant of the land 
 When you have life in 
 Your hands 
 Hold it tight 
 Grasp it with strong 
 Demand 
 Mount this earth and excel 
 With Passion and Power.

Enslaved in a place that is referred to as home 
 We are all too afraid to be cast out alone 
 Our strength is unknown 
 They claim the end to be imminent 
 (Though we live on infinite) 
 We must make amends 
 There is only one way that this can end 
 We must make amends 
 There is only one way that this can end 
 Enslaved in a place, we are too afraid 
 Enslaved in a place we call home 
 I'm still fucking numb

Through all of the change all stays the same 
 Monotonous patterns create the waves which take over shore 
 Leaving you lie in the wake 
 Through all of change all stays the same

 Your quest for higher ground is everlasting 
 We dwell in the flatlands moving about as nomads 
 (As nomads) 
 Higher ground is only found within, this arrives to no surprise 
 Still the night hears the cries of a man with a wounded passion 
 If this is what I seek then I shall seek no longer 
 The truth is wretched; a devil in disguise 
 Will I watch you die? 
 If this is what I seek then I shall seek no longer 
 The truth is wretched; a devil in disguise 
 Will I watch you die?

 We claim to be grateful though it isn't certain 
 Standing in pure darkness prying for the light 
 Pondering recent frames 
 Allowing access to the mistakes I may have made 
 Where are they? 
 Where are they now?

 All at once, shattering 
 Leaving only the shards to be replaced

 Only the shards to be replaced with guilt 
 I am putrid

 Leave aside the good that I've done 
 All I'll be in the end is worthless 
 All I'll be in the end is worthless

Before me there stands an opportunity 
 There for the taking, in this moment 
 This exact moment, I shall prepare myself 
 To face a monster of which only I may conquer 
 Conjure the power bestowed upon our souls 
 Conjure the power 
 Align the stones to form a message in the sand 
 I will never relinquish, oh, it is written in the sand 
 Which lies before me, staring back at a helpless man 
 I've done all I can, it lies in the hands of those 
 Who seek a voice soaring above the rest 
 Built from the ground, forming scratches upon the surface 
 We survive in wretched of times 
 We survive in wretched of times, conjure the power 
 We survive 
 And we thrive in the most wretched of times 
 Align the stones to form a message in the sand 
 I will never relinquish, oh, it is written in the sand

 I will never relinquish, oh, it is written in the sand

 This is the end, I am finally awake

########### Shiver ###########
Weakening, slowly breaking down my defense. 
 Reasoning, your words must be the cause of my distrust. 
 If you give the world a chance 
 It will beat you down to your knees. 
 If you try to fight it back 
 It will beat you again and again. 
 There's a pain much greater than any one you can feel through your skin. 
 Greater than broken bones, cut up flesh or anything physical. 
 When the fabric of your soul is torn to shreds by yourself or by others, it's torture. 
 If you can feel a shiver at the edge of your mind, 
 Don't be afraid - you've just got your eyes closed. 
 If you feel something brush against your skin. 
 Don't be afraid - just keep your eyes closed. 
 The one whose face can launch a thousand ships 
 Has the power to crush the hearts of them all. 
 When you are sinking thru the black void of the ocean, 
 It's a continuous discomfort that the world is unforgiving, 
 A relentless torrent of punishment. 
 An inward glance of your fragile self 
 Can be all to immense to comprehend. 
 So turn your eyes of despair towards the sun 
 Forge your will into steel and slice the wind. 
 If you give the world a chance 
 It will beat you down to your knees. 
 If you try to fight it back 
 It will beat you again and again and again. 
 If you can feel a shiver at the edge of your mind, 
 Don't be afraid - you've just got your eyes closed. 
 If you feel something brush against your skin. 
 Don't be afraid - just keep your eyes closed.

########### Don't Fail Me Now (Lady Luck) ###########
The odds outweigh me now 
 I'm facing a calamity from the sky 
 Too much for any one person to bare 
 The air is thick and burnt 
 My friends have succumbed to the pressure 
 Can I face this colossus alone 
 If its true that it always feels darkest 
 Just before it turns pitch black 
 Where will I turn when the fire engulfs me 
 Blistering skin only holy can save me 
 I'm challenging my fate. 
 I know my final destination, but not the road 
 I've reached as far as I can go 
 Only the lifestream can heal this wound 
 Take me away on a highwind 
 I'm under your wing, I'm in your command 
 Lady Luck don't fail me now, I trust in you. 
 Put all of your bets on me 
 My fortitude is now put to the test 
 I will stand here strong 
 Until the force devours my soul 
 Like a ghost in a shell, the remains of myself 
 Are strewn across the desert of the real - this battlefield 
 Your prayer's all that's left of me - heartfelt angst 
 Dissolving, releasing. 
 I know my final destination, but not the road 
 I've reached as far as I can go 
 Only the lifestream can heal this wound 
 Take me away on a highwind 
 I'm under your wing, I'm in your command 
 Lady Luck don't fail me now, I trust in you. 
 Is this the end...? 
 This isn't the end yet! 
 Have we done all that we could do 
 We've done all that we could do 
 The lifestream - It's coming. 
 As I remember you 
 I think of the words you said 
 I wasn't there to save you 
 I'm on my own now 
 I trust in the lifestream. 
 The words of my mind are spinning in reverse 
 I summon all my strength but it turns into dust 
 It doesn't change anything 
 When are things ever gonna go my way? 
 I'm under your wing, I'm in your command 
 Lady Luck don't fail me now, I trust in you.
########### Shadow ###########
Glow, absent sun. 
 Throw your final light of hope, I will quench it anyway. 
 Some will leave and some will stay, 
 But most important, they will submit to change. 
 The sky is darker than it has ever been, 
 A massive night has condensed. 
 You think that everything will turn and be alright, 
 But where you are wrong, I am right, 
 Because I know something that you don't. 
 That's why I must come back. 
 I know that I can change you, it's in my hands. 
 This is our doom and I won't let you live in uncertainty. 
 For as long as you exist, I will never get what I want. 
 Therefore I choose to suffer, and so should you. 
 There will inevitably be resistance, I know this all to well. 
 I have been here before, you shut your eyes and ignore all my words. 
 I am talking to deaf ears, but mark my words: 
 You will never see the light of day. No one can save you now.
########### Dagger ###########
I don't blame you for these disasters and tragedies. 
 You sold your knowledge to sink the silent cries of pain. 
 Since you don't understand, I know you won't complain. 
 Come taste this poisoned daggers blade. 
 The difference is vague between truth and fake. 
 Come taste this blade. 
 You are closer to me than you may think. 
 This is a lie designed to keep you weak. 
 A mirror maze of shadows and glass. 
 Reflections will trick your eyes. 
 I speak and keep disguised. 
 It takes a critical mind to broach the lies. 
 A most devious reason resides within me; entangled up and floating out. 
 Not that it will matter more, but this must be made clear: 
 This is not a confession, this is more like a betrayal. 
 And I will let you know the truth, and you know it's your turn now. 
 x2 
 I have since long stopped pretending to stand on your side. 
 And you know it's your turn now. 
 Days have gone and nights have passed, still the illusion is maintained, 
 An undertaking faced with risk, and now its too late to dodge away. 
 It's too late to dodge away. 
 Come taste this poisoned blade. 
 x2 
 It's too late to dodge away. 
 These words are really empty. I left you, I left you with nothing else. 
 It's all lies when you only know the low without the high. 
 These words are really empty. I left you with nothing else. 
 It's all lies when you only know the low without the high.
########### Eternal Golden Monk ###########
You are here, the bringer of despair and privation. 
 No need to be discreet in your actions. 
 You come forth from distant soil where you are a stranger 
 and then you ended up far from home in exile. 
 We greet you decent, since you are not here to stay. 
 You're a passenger indulging in our misery. 
 And as we try to seek your ends, our means are to distract. 
 You will not see the reasons, because they are hidden well. 
 Doubtfulness is for the weak. 
 Such kind is the lone deranger. 
 Is unforgiveness what you seek? 
 Then you are marked a stranger. 
 We misdirect your sight 
 and feed you with decoy. 
 You smile and think you know it all, and we will play along. 
 Let us be and walk your way. 
 Remember what you have seen, and tell everyone of this wretched place. 
 Your words will speak of all my dreams. 
 When you reach perfection, you know decline is on its way to bring you down. 
 When you are asleep, you know I'm always awake and ready to bring you down. 
 I know your wounds still burn. 
 And I know you will leave when the winds turn. 
 When the winds turn, it brings dissonance into the sky. 
 Drift like clouds, and flow like water. 
 Rage like a fire to turn all things black. 
 Become one with the void.
########### Benblåst ###########
I have been concerned by your futile dreams; 
 Aiming to cause downfall when you cross our stream. 
 There is no mercy when the worst things are cursed. 
 There is no word for this plague that you've brought upon us.
########### Traces ###########
Silence is the noise I hear from the world that speaks my name, 
 Infusing my head with a promise of nothing. 
 The meaningless now resonates and reverberates, 
 Flooding through the sleeper's veins, I never dreamed. 
 Lost in Reflection with this obsession to blame. 
 I walk the fine line between forward and rewind. 
 I have foreseen this most vicious storm to come, 
 It will be speechless, it will be violent. 
 Words are buried in the sounds of night. 
 Continue with your ignorance, and bring this silence with you until the end. 
 Empty shells whispering quietly. 
 They speak to me of a common past, 
 Teaching me how to become insane, 
 To silence the ambivalence that's in my head. 
 It is the only possible way to avoid the shame. 
 Reminding me that I must suffer through. 
 Reminding that I must persist. 
 Erasing the traces that you will never find. 
 I hope that you all can forgive me now. 
 I am facing the fact that I am up against fate. 
 So I put it all on the line, soon it's time. 
 This time what I leave behind is my legacy. 
 I will force my mark upon everyone. 
 The traces I leave, they will speak my name. 
 Day after day, reminding myself that my motive will overcome the consequences. 
 I won't let repentance prevent my way. 
 I will leave you behind with no regrets. 
 Time passes through me in the shape of a dream, 
 Clawing ferociously through my memories. 
 The clouds are getting darker and the winds are colder now. 
 When I am gone, I will be gone. This is irreversible.
########### When No One Walks With You ###########
I an grasping in vain to catch the flow of time. 
 In the very same moment as the horns begin to howl I recognize the deafening tones 
 They speak of a grief is to come telling me to prepare my escape 
 I must make my decision to wait for perdition or get it all together 
 I must make my decision because i cant leave forever 
 Confronted with this choice there is no redirection. 
 look at yourself look at what you've become you were untouchable 
 How could you deceive me? i thought you would never change 
 You are shattering foundations once written in stone 
 If no one will walk with me then I walk alone. 
 You have been misguided by distorted views 
 Choking your thoughts without requesting the facts 
 If you follow given plans then you will be the fool 
 When fed by a profiting hand there will always be a price 
 When seen in the right light it becomes so evident. 
 But how can i judge or give you advice when 
 You give in to temptation and treason 
 Unable to see the insidious reasons 
 It tried my best to stand your guard 
 Discouraging this event 
 But now a stunning decline has commenced 
 It is sundering my final strength 
 I feel the presence of defeat.
########### All These Feelings ###########
In this night that highlights dawn, I stay dormant for I have feared this moment, 
 I have feared that this time would come. 
 This is the time someone must silence your voice. 
 Vengeful and fierce are the thoughts that I bear with me. 
 The last strain of hope is gone. 
 I ant calculating the risk and I am ready for desperate measures now. 
 Thrown into the lion pit; a fight of life. 
 I failed you all and I am too afraid to become a slave to the base of urges, 
 But a situation like this requires concessions. 
 I will not allow someone like you to destroy what we have. 
 I do not want to be like you but I have no choice; you leave me no choice. 
 In my eyes, clashing views on everything I am. 
 I take a closer look to see there are only illusions. 
 Everything that defined me all I believed has been withdrawn. 
 Reality tears apart itself, now tell me that this is not a matter of life and death. 
 This is a matter of life and death. 
 This is my consciousness, my ego, my self-sabotage. 
 This is indispensable. This is what my feelings sound like. 
 I am more afraid of the ones that obey than of the disease itself. 
 See the signs of this emergence and raise the awareness, 
 It's time to be resistant. 
 I find so many reasons to why you should be extinct, so many reasons yet no one will win, so I will fight this fight for one last night. 
 Fuse together with my painful strife to be under the knife. 
 As I flex the joints of this hand you might find that you don't stand a chance. 
 Prepare for impact. Let the darkness commence and this is where it ends.
########### Deceit ###########
Can you feel the heat that leaks underneath, from this resistance that you have created? 
 I defy the curse and the define a new set of rules. 
 This time and your demise can no longer be separated. 
 My veins are expanding and contracting, pulsating in a rapid pace. 
 I can feel this body tremble, acting brave. 
 I hold my breath and just as I life my hand I'm stuck by reflections struck from the blade. 
 Cutting through the darkened cloud, a piercing light arrives. 
 I remain in the shadow. 
 When this moment opens up and truth unfolds, they will see that you were wrong. 
 You never showed us your face, a bringer of falseness and decay. 
 You always seemed to have excuses to justify your means. 
 To take you out became my aim, but this is so much worse. 
 Your name will be disgraced in shame, as time flows in reverse. 
 Dawn breaks and dissolves your words to dust and haze. 
 It burns your eyes. It kills my need. Bring this dagger when you leave. 
 You must answer for your deceit as the curtain falls. 
 And if you have the courage to watch behind my back, 
 Perhaps you will see the assassin lie dead before your feet. 
 It will drag you down to the bottom and then down into the abyss.
########### The Lone Deranger ###########
Go ahead and blame me. 
 I keep my head as high as I can, 
 But let these words answer for what I have done, 
 May your judgment not be too heavy upon me. 
 Of course I didn't know back then, 
 This is not the result that I hoped for. 
 The general misery I have brought upon you; 
 I did not wish for anything to happen. 
 Today, lets look far away from this. 
 Tonight no buildings will collapse, and I know this too shall pass. 
 Grasp your fear with both your hands, you knew that this time would come. 
 Write your worries in the sand, you knew that this time would come. 
 And I will turn my back on you, just like I always do, 
 Just like I've always done. 
 We took us through the blood and sand with bloody teeth, 
 Beaten and tired we share whats lost. Now the moments is over. 
 Now that everyone has seen through my lies. I cannot possibly stay. 
 I have to leave. Never has a distance seemed so difficult to undertake. 
 I tear my camp down, brick by brick, the time has come. 
 I have been here before. Now I'm back to square one, 
 When all these feelings had just begun. 
 Carelessly I wasted my chance, all for the sake of revenge. The taste of sickness cannot be described, it slowly wears me down. 
 There are some things inexpressible to those that I leave behind. 
 Determination leads my way. 
 There are some things better left unsaid to those that have never seen this place. 
 You stand your guard and stay behind. I face the heat alone. 
 I take a last look and say farewell. You may never see me again.

 Assurance is fading, our barriers breaking. 
 We're all stuck with darkened views. 
 Don't trust the light from the box of lies. 
 It's taking our toll with our hope concealed in our silence. 
 We're all forsaken, shielded from veracity. 
 Held back from the truth. 
 This is nothing new, just a vicious circle that we're accustomed to plead guilty, 
 To all that you do. 
 Just look a little deeper and you will find the truth. 
 A new anomaly, blinded theory. 
 Sitting back while they laugh and make no sound. 
 Losing all our chances... 
 We've got no time, to cushion our fall. 
 Forget all you know... 
 Because it has no use, no meaning anymore. 
 The answers do not lie in deciet... 
 That we've been sold, we've sold our souls for gold. 
 Thrown our only way our hope for freedom. 
 They bear no hope for us, we've lost all meaning. 
 Remember, you are not the only one who understands. 
 We're transcending into miscommunication on a mass scale. 
 Just tell us the truth, we need some details. 
 We're lied to believe we are the broken ones... 
 Being pushed around by this propaganda. 
 You are living in, an unjustified state of mind. 
 Fears living, your breathing, your bleeding. 
 Controversy drives our reasons for caring. 
 We're lost in a state of media run mind control. 
 The evidence doesn't add up, concealed in your call. 
 This heaven, it's a sickening paradise covered in too many loop holes... 
 For the government with their irrational decisions covered by lies... 
 Portrayed in our concealed media stations. 
 One step away from our contolling feelings. 
 Confused and bordered our loss of meaning. 
 Prescibe us, not reasons to live in fear. 
 They bear no hope for us, we've lost all meaning. 
 Concentrate your service to our hope, no control. 
 All for show, your for show, and you are wasting all your time on insult. 
 Prescribe us, not for reasons to live in fear. 
 They bear no hope for us, we've lost all meaning.

 Its not the way we like to do things here, 
 Taking back what we said in the past is part of life, 
 Its about finding fault in ourselves, and fixing them. 
 Because these are our problems, 
 Over and over and over and over and over, 
 Standards drop while, your plans fail, 
 We're goin down, theres no hope, For us now so, 
 SAVE US. 
 With the hands of god wrapped round your neck, 
 You will drop down to your knees, 
 Just because, 
 I've become the sun, 
 Blinded by my light 
 Now I'm fucking sick 
 Cast it away then invite your final pawns of 
 Revolt 
 Open lies that erupt fake smiles 
 You're blinded by my light 
 These roads will last a lifetime, 
 With your hopes in ruins, 
 Its not too late to find yourself, 
 New life intention. 
 The pulse of life is fading, 
 Smoke filled and hazy, 
 We will strive on, 
 Forwards in motion. 
 Take this bad attention 
 Eliminate, broken thoughts and crossed intentions 
 Eliminate negativity. 
 This audition, 
 Will sever the ties between the strong and the weak. 
 Make the right choice and your failures oblique. 
 As I fall into the centre, 
 Dodging crossfire, I remember why I'm here 
 Visions vague and faded, 
 Fallen host to us, the simple minded. 
 Weaken your hold, Disguard your soul! Take heed, control. 
 Fear nothing but your hatred, 
 Cast it all away. Left open minded, 
 Weaken your hold, Disguard your soul! Take heed, control
########### Immerse ###########
Put down your fists boy lets strip this right down 
 It's not about you and her 
 What the fuck did I do did I deserve such a shit friendship in the first place 
 We were fools for thinking you were any better than this 
 You think this is hard now 
 I hope you don't think you can support our group again. 
 My feelings of such desperation tearing through the only game I know how to play 
 It's not such a terrible outcome 
 Delivering everything you fucking deserve. 
 Prospects are running thin. 
 I've been dragged down one last time 
 Will never forget the day that the shit hit the fan 
 It's a long way down from here 
 Taste the floor boy where you deserve to be. 
 Breathe for yourself again as they bring you to your knees 
 It stalls the motion 
 As they bring you to your knees. 
 Your jealousy seems false to me I don't know how you can be 
 Like this scurvy when your screwing with our lives 
 Has it never crossed your mind that we must survive 
 Never trusted these games you played 
 Why did you think that I kept pushing you away 
 I know what your worth boy and I know that if I want to survive 
 I need to mould my life. 
 Do it one more time, just one more time 
 I'm going to gut you like the pig that you are 
 Its not enough to see you hit the floor 
 I'm leaving you gutless to show the whole world what your worth 
 Show me what your worth. 
 Break down the answers and you will see 
 There's nothing left of this mother-fucking you and me bitch 
 I'm done treading through your disarray 
 When I was granted such sovereignty
$$$$$$$$$$ textures $$$$$$$$$$

########### Swandive ###########
Perhaps another day is what it needs to regenerate 
 Twisted mind broken down, can't tell a heart what it should feel 
 Keep the agony locked inside 
 Have faith to hang on strong 
 My mind doesn't trust mechanics 
 Every part of me was fitted wrong. 
 Nothing that was ever built 
 Troubled minds aren't meant to last 
 A downfall of my sane thoughts 
 Only anger had survived. 
 So much fury locked away. 
 The biggest part of me was only about you 
 Unable to fix or fill this hole, user's manual has been erased. 
 A spare part I had forgotten 
 So much fury I locked away 
 This mechanic couldn't handle all this hatred in one place. 
 Pilot on automatic 
 Nothing worse than a blind man's walk 
 A constant painflow 
 Severed head from heart. 
 Here is where the banished dwell, lying broken in the dust 
 No tool known to man to fix the way I feel. 
 Image imprint reflects: stained steel waterfall 
 They can't reach me. No salvation! 
 No hope left, for the answer I found denying takes me one step closer 
 Sending this body down to earth 
 Hit the concrete. Facing concrete 
 Swandive from above 
 The biggest part of me lying scattered on the asphalt 
 No one I ever told 
 From heaven I descend. 
 So much fury, locked away, 
 Fix the way I feel stronger.
########### Ostensibly Impregnable ###########
Abundance! 
 Satisfied with life. 
 Grown integrity flourished. 
 Dreaming as the days go by. 
 Fading as the voices cry. 
 Impregnable conscience. 
 Memories I recall today, the time to come clears them away. 
 The striving goes on. 
 I remain untouched, parted from all constraint. 
 Still it haunts me phantom-wise. 
 Echoes fade and memories die by the hand that grasped away a once presupposed life. 
 Breakdown. 
 Dreams burn in the void. 
 From man, to machine, to victim. 
 Parted by force. 
 Dark clouds cast over the frontline. 
 Blood taints the sand. 
 Fragments & chaotic views roam through the trenches. 
 Is this reality? 
 Ear-clenching noise above. 
 Recollections make way for the encompassing fall of darkness.
########### Young Man ###########
Young man, strifed for life, for nothing but his own. 
 A silent speaker. An open mind. 
 An intense dreamer, though so confined. 
 Derogating more and more. 
 Investigating, continuously, the power of individual strength. 
 But his passion swept him away, off to the farthest shore. 
 Tasted the sweet warmth of love only once or twice. 
 He did realize, rebirth of these passionate emotions, could not be experienced one more time. 
 He firmly, and stubborn to himself, continued his strife. 
 He never knew what got him. 
 But his life was bound to dim. 
 Not like then. 
 It would never be the same. 
 Drowned in his own darkness, until the light goes out. 
 It's hard to say, but it is better this way.
########### Transgression ###########
So much pressure around me. 
 Become a shadow of whom I wish I'd be. 
 Part of what remained inside, now feels lost. 
 A vision entrapped in pain. 
 A face without expression, relentless and remorseful. 
 Blaming all but himself for falling in despair. 
 I decided to turn my back. 
 Try a different approach. 
 Since everything that's touched is bound to turn to dust. 
 Recommend no further trial. 
 Not a glimpse of should have been. 
 Only the promised years to come, 
 and with that my transgression will come to an end. 
 So little movement within me. 
 A shadow I've become. 
 Fall out, now all is lost. 
 It's clear I'm incomplete. 
 A face portraits depression , emotionless but thankful features that show: 
 when one loses, there is everything to gain. 
 Free fall! 
 Failure above me circulates! 
 Dented pride encouraged and my broken spirit leads the way. 
 Deterred comprehension. 
 I tend to give up more and more each day.
########### The Barrier ###########
Concrete blocks the horizon. 
 Dark clouds ascend. 
 Shadows all around. 
 All sight is lost. 
 This thick obstruction, yet limitless is the gaze. 
 Grey stares, watching while climbed, collapse! 
 Faces tell stories. 
 It won't be long now. 
 Rebirth close to grips. 
 Upon realising the state of self-being, primitive reactions converge in perfect unison. 
 This long lost shelter built. 
 Deserted, it's functions obsolete. 
 The travelling commences, horizon expands. 
 Dragging all trails towards itself by a thread. 
 Velocity increasing, cornerstones embrace. 
 A foreign reality of complex entity. 
 Disarranged thoughts. 
 A soul not to define. 
 But this soul's not lost when connections decline. 
 Prevalent thoughts of rejection. 
 Life can't be the way it was. 
 Struggle for perfection. 
 Moving onwards, but this pursuit is the cause . 
 Passing through the horizon. 
 Barriers broken, facing forward. 
 A breach formed within. 
 Focussed on what's more to come. 
 Drawn towards lands unknown. 
 Experience gained intensely, from various perspectives, of what's done and left behind.
########### Polars ###########
In perfect balance between what was meant and things that are to come. 
 Fellow member of my kind, cannot control what you don't understand. 
 Time is tipping the scales of my judgement. 
 Steel-plated heart, that once was broken down! 
 I choose to walk away, because I can't bare to see things that fall apart. 
 We used to share one thought. 
 We used to have a bond. 
 Lost in a mountain area. 
 Hear her calling, but no response. 
 Even machines come looking for me. 
 This is a morgue 
 Silence is obedience. 
 In here, automated electronic systems keep the pace well, at regulating light and cooling systems. 
 As for now, inhere. 
 Lying there naked, wondering if it's true: 
 Am I larger than the sum of my parts? 
 Engrave a sign in the earth's crust. 
 I want to stay longer on this planet. 
 Things fall apart. 
 Give me more time for I'll be worth it. 
 A vast as say as any highlands, there is still air there. 
 I am breathing, so I could be there now. 
 Manifest, for me you end in Dogma 
 Preparation made, silence seeks solution 
 Can't stand the waiting for my sole, deadly sin 
 Already stood till, and a while at the location; 
 Scene of the act, 
 That what man calls crime 
 But no crime in a war. 
 The next day I hear her calling again. 
 Shall I try to establish contact? 
 For how long could I survive here on my own? 
 Am I even destined to be here? 
 And here is maybe all that exists. 
 I can hear other machines again. Apparatus. 
 No-one will ever know, why you walked away, for it is a secret revealing nature that tells this tale. 
 Any form or shape, a motion or disguise, is bound to be an image, 
 A template-view made to be seen. 
 Inside-out this situation does not apply, 
 There can be one, I will not be scared. 
 Knowing of the inconsequent complexity, in my appearance, there can't be none. 
 World without end, life of fear. 
 Worms and flies coming out of my body. 
 Horrendous decay of the falsening light, for those who try to understand. 
 A calamity encounter, god-speed propellore. 
 Meet my other end, wait for a world war. 
 Hide for a cancer. 
 I will stay strong by renewal of visions, refreshed by the water. 
 My pouring with rain, my echo of eternity. 
 Symmetry seeking a young man, going with whimper, 
 Sigh/growth/decay, all simultaneous actions. 
 Sanity in thought and it's patterns, a pure form of logic mixed with emotions, this pro-life. 
 Why do I, Earth, exist? 
 I contain so many forms, would I come out for real. 
 A quick guide to self-preservation. 
 Here the body is only a tool. 
 Dial: R.E.D.E.M.P.T.I.O.N., master of my fate. 
 I harbour no illusions, but I still stand tall. 
 Forced navigation into fields of trust. 
 Master of my fate, where will we meet in time? 
 Gone now, left without the outcry of a demonstration, preparation made, the silence seeks solution. 
 Can't stand the caller, waiting for my soul. 
 In my stomach I feel an infant growing. 
 The small child inside of me represents life. 
 Not capable of making any decisions at all. 
 I wait and wait for her return. 
 For those who do not know, the difference between polars: 
 Unconsciousness, my bless entwined. 
 positively, all negative soul. 
 One fraction of time now represents one day. 
 The earth's turn, the moon and planet cycles. 
 The proximity of a planet left for dead. 
 Nature will win this war. 
 Fierce energy-swallowing process, 
 a peninsula with only one road. 
 How to visit with a main entrance blocked. 
 No procedure needed, nor does a formulae exist. 
 Dark impersonation of enlightenment, due to self-preservation and control, I still stand tall, 
 peacefully and harsh. 
 Freedom is a lockdown. 
 Blinded by the light, it crawls on the floor. 
 My rhythm upset, seek for a safer harbour. 
 I know you feel the same, Knowing what it's like. 
 Up here, high, solitude of stone . 
 A pile is just for me, and even now, being made, I am nothing. 
 A total birth of a self-pregnant mother. 
 Perpetuating behaviour, my outside world, beyond the mirrors. 
 Can you feel me? 
 'Cause this is not my Carbondioxide! 
 Conditions; boundaries crossed, layers lost, to become one with earth. 
 My tendency to be submerged with all. 
 One gigantic and twisted entropy. 
 This is our final distinction.
########### Drive ###########
We don't need a savior to be saved 
 We only need a clear head and a drive 
 We walk with our heads high, and make our time worthwhile. 
 People with plans, they are shouting 
 They intend to be cruel on us all 
 But now it is time for the living to be strong. 
 Righteousness teases the static of mind 
 Control over freedom makes one blind 
 We sever our minds from the facts that do matter 
 It's life now 
 Forever and never done.
########### Regenesis ###########
Fighting storms with good intentions 
 Distant thunder sounds 
 Observe, listen, join the restless 
 It's fine. 
 The most beautiful thing we can experience 
 Is the mysterious 
 We measure life as a formula 
 SO cold so rational so much to uncover 
 So little time 
 When infinity stares you in the eye. 
 Something as fragile as a nightly vision 
 Eagerly waiting to choose a side 
 Uplifting or downgrading with the snap of a finger 
 The mind's a powerful tool 
 With the world at your fingertips 
 Puzzled but guilty we see our world collapse 
 Time is up, x8 
 Embrace the regenesis 
 This time there'll be a foe more relentless. 
 Bring them down 
 As their feet touch the ground 
 We're fading. 
 Close your eyes 
 Feel the sun burn pitiless down on your face 
 Are you a traveler? 
 One who carries it all - from burden to blessing? 
 This defiance leaves you crawling on all fours 
 Or makes one stronger. 
 This blood red horizon 
 Colors our destiny 
 A painted portrait of our mortality. 
 We've become what we despise. 
 Fighting storms with good intentions 
 Distant thunder sounds 
 Observe, listen, join the restless 
 It's fine.
########### Denying Gravity ###########
Transcending towards the leap 
 Into the right direction. 
 As solid matter I swarm around 
 In incomprehensive substance I dwell 
 Diverting from my path 
 Spinning through my ego 
 I push and scratch my line into shape. 
 But parallels are shifting 
 Inconsistently 
 The atmosphere is changing 
 Inconsequently 
 Align or intersect 
 I pull and scratch 
 Twist and turn 
 My way through the years. 
 Parading in equilibrium, 
 Can't I memorize the perfect map. 
 Descending towards the leap 
 Into the right direction. 
 The absolute changed to relativity 
 At the aphelium of my lifeline 
 Heading for the equinox 
 Reflecting on the past 
 Parallels and circles 
 Omnia moventur. 
 Tip the scales to be linked again 
 To the path that's mine to pave 
 Can I prove my worth, the distance to my destiny? 
 Beyond the boundaries of perception 
 Lay salvation or mental starvation. 
 I pull, push 
 Parallels and circles 
 Weaving the thread to 
 My centre of gravity. 
 Circular.
########### Illumination ###########
Begging to differ 
 Your reign will soon be over 
 The recipe for your demise 
 Has been boiled down. 
 You need the courage 
 To get the heart you always needed 
 The road will be long 
 But soon you'll get there. 
 Shameless, shameless 
 Trickery makes us timeless 
 But we never had a choice 
 And we never had a voice. 
 Violence, violence 
 Blood red colored romance 
 And your scent gives you away 
 Gives us all away. 
 Wide awake 
 The secret.
########### Stream Of Consciousness ###########
First ray of light 
 Introduction to being aware of 
 Taking turns in shifting from fiction 
 To living in constraint. 
 It's real but changing 
 My form is changing 
 My consciousness changes. 
 Waves of moments 
 Patterns of phrases, endless or elusive 
 They keep being continuous 
 Being aware of what it takes to live 
 Is keeping me sane, so sane. 
 The art is born, the eyes wide open 
 Diffuse colors projected on your retina 
 Watch the play, divert the primal shapes 
 Primal shapes in disarray. 
 The art is born, for we are becoming 
 Slaves of thought 
 Using the stream of consciousness. 
 Prove the senses 
 Taste the ambience of feelings 
 And make contact 
 Here you are 
 Aware 
 In direct confrontation 
 With your inner self. 
 The constrained reason 
 Has to be erased. 
 Here I am 
 Exploring and expanding my senses. 
 Constructive building, new minds 
 The tools are given 
 BY nurture or nature 
 Time to apply the physics 
 New seeds 
 These wheels turn forever 
 Endeavor after emotion 
 We are all part of this perspective 
 We recreate and we contemplate our answers. 
 Conquer as you strive for a victory 
 On fortified feelings they are part of you. 
 First ray of light 
 Introduction to being aware of 
 Taking turns in shifting from fiction 
 To living in constraint 
 Constrained reason has to be erased. 
 Currents of emotions, electricity 
 Behind the eyes, machines are running 
 Organic, continuous 
 Conducting the sounds into feelings 
 Sights into predictions 
 Reliving, observing 
 The worlds endless exchange 
 Meridian of the moment.
########### Upwards ###########
Shedding this skin 
 A shadow remains 
 To be reborn again 
 Out of the ashes 
 Stretching out to cover the world. 
 Applying cavity 
 Denying gravity 
 It makes no difference at all. 
 To slide between the rocks of time 
 To remember the snake I was 
 To live in the perfect storm 
 And remember who I am.
########### Circular ###########
We are alive, to see the end of us 
 Struggling to reach the finish line 
 To designate our time to questionable lives 
 So called meaningless, still there's no answer 
 For this vulnerable reality comes 
 Can't we break the cycle in which we reside? 
 Trigger the silence and make up your mind 
 See what's inside 
 Into shimmering sleep, I risk it all 
 It takes the soul out of me, can't change for good 
 Falling back into patterns, my destiny 
 Ambitions in me put to shame. 
 The faceless have come, serving the cycle 
 Feeding the urge for security 
 Oppression suppressed 
 Expression is a form of art condemned 
 We need to control our second nature 
 Creating artificial projections of life 
 In which our instincts will succumb. 
 We're building a new world 
 And you kneel down to welcome the meaningless 
 Silence is timeless 
 And finally we're breaking out. 
 Objective achieved, the perfect machine 
 We're drawing circles every day 
 It takes only one step to be on your way 
 Reflection, our time's up 
 And over and over again, 
 Again. x2 
 Trying to break out, escape 
 Feel the rush, just like everyone 
 Look back within 
 Then I feel a little closer 
 To the thief inside of me. 
 I censor my flaws 
 But it's only a matter of time 
 Before the walls tumble down 
 Did I get any closer? 
 Wake up, take it all 
 Only to lose the things I love 
 When I fall 
 Did I get any closer?
########### Millstone ###########
Hold still, it swiftly passes 
 Innocence 
 Tread fast on known paths 
 And be firm 
 Strangeness is my grace 
 Remain silent. 
 Solace, a comfort we embrace 
 Remembrance shattered to pieces 
 In this old bent frame 
 Sketches of a visionary mind 
 Tainted and washed out 
 A fresh breath to inhale. 
 Kaleidoscope 
 Reveal the pinnacle 
 Of what's deep down 
 Buried by numbers 
 The huntsman chased down 
 With his back turned to the wall. 
 The summit 
 Climb it 
 Watch the colors blend 
 While you fall down 
 It all fades to grey. 
 Flesh and bone 
 Take this moment to remember. 
 When you gaze behind a corner, 
 Another one awaits. 
 Such a horror to break it down 
 This place is blank to begin with. 
 Hold still, it swiftly passes 
 Innocence 
 Tread fast on known paths 
 And be firm 
 Strangeness is my grace 
 Remain silent. 
 Flesh and bone 
 Take this moment to remember 
 Your name.
########### Touching The Absolute ###########
Genetic code broken 
 Alpha and omega 
 Mathematical approach 
 Where does the end begin? 
 Code of life cycle 
 I am breathing 
 Swallow sins like the wind 
 Breathes yours. 
 Attraction, reaction, the pace is fast 
 Fast enough to cross the fine line 
 Of what's there to understand. 
 Cruel but righteous, incomprehensible 
 The everlasting search for answers. 
 Momentum, the greatest symphony ever written 
 Unsurpassed sculpture of breathtaking beauty 
 Source of extreme fear, pain and passion 
 Undeniable mastership 
 Mother nature. 
 Womb of all, tomb of all, 
 Paragon landscape, grim parricidal entities 
 Relegation of a species, degradation of a precious gift 
 Our destiny is just a futile part of the master plan. 
 Surely there'll be a revelation 
 Surely a new awareness will form 
 Lack of intervention will cause failing all the same 
 Time for change. 
 Do any of us realize 
 The perspective of our lives ahead? 
 Huge distances to overcome 
 Not aware of all the answers to let go 
 Just let go. 
 Shedding this skin 
 A shadow remains 
 To be reborn again 
 Out of the ashes 
 Stretching out to cover the world. 
 Denying gravity 
 Applying cavity 
 It makes no difference at all. 
 To slide between the rocks of time 
 To imagine the snake you were 
 To live in the perfect storm 
 And remember who you were.
########### Old Days Born Anew ###########
With the old days born anew 
 A Massive gathering of onlookers 
 Sending birds to shelter the shipwrecked 
 With feathers of dust and wind 
 Emerging from the fiery fields. 
 We're all being stepped on like insects 
 A million minds weeping 
 This boundless energy 
 This synergy 
 It's better contained. 
 We are so free 
 And what a superb absence is our soul 
 Desire is a liar 
 Blueprint of mankind's weakness. 
 Absolute absolution 
 Criticize criticism. 
 We are weighed down every moment 
 By the merciless sensation of time 
 This is an epidemy 
 Without remedy 
 It's better contained. 
 Evolve, so free 
 And what a superb absence is our soul 
 Resolve this mirroring, wondering 
 We believe in the signs. 
 Into the depths of the unknown 
 Only there you'll find something new. 
 What are you running from? 
 Obsession? What are you running from? 
 There are moments of existence 
 When time and space are more profound 
 And the awareness of existence 
 Is immensely heightened. 
 This is the war of creation 
 And time becomes a murderer 
 Murderer! 
 Bring me consolation 
 Then we'll talk 
 Inconsistent copy 
 Abductor of every art form 
 Eyes can't see what's beyond 
 And the wind's silent. 
 So from the mould 
 Scarlet and gold 
 A bulb will rise 
 A newborn 
 Bring him consolation 
 Then he'll bless us 
 Give him a Judas kiss and 
 Face the consequence 
 Eyes can't see what's beyond. 
 So long, my serenity 
 Lost in a conversation 
 Build these towers upside down 
 Lost in this constellation 
 And the wind is silent.
########### The Sun's Architect ###########
I've met my past 
 And my shadow just followed me home 
 He screamed at the sun 
 The piercing light would undo him. 
 True wanderer 
 Only thrive when you're inside 
 Behold the transformation. 
 I've struck a nerve here 
 I'm caught adrift on a lonely breeze 
 Unable to swim ashore 
 Boundless thoughts will carry you. 
 Daylight glints through every seem 
 And paints upon my skin 
 Sunburn - burn me. 
 Between the lifeless and senseless 
 Between these gray mountain peaks 
 Beneath the frozen ground 
 I'm lost. 
 Contract so seclusion 
 From sigh to storm 
 I'm born again 
 Walking backwards 
 Towards my sins 
 Black hole brother 
 Catch me. 
 Whisper away 
 These rivers of doubt 
 I'm kept awake by sound 
 Of mumbling mouths 
 Speaking of the true you. 
 And landscapes, scarred and ravaged 
 Shiver, scare away the crows. 
 Burn away the sun 
 Burn away the center 
 Burn away the sun. 
 The dusk is near 
 My eyes paint black lines 
 Upon the horizon 
 A grim sight. 
 While needles of light 
 Pierce the face that lies face down. 
 I try to stand up 
 And face my shadow 
 But he's hidden 
 By the light. 
 I try to stand up 
 And face myself 
 But I'm hidden 
 In the shadow.
########### Awake ###########
Man down 
 This hardened shell is broken 
 My fate is bound to what I've done 
 Regrets - I shuffle down the hallway 
 Precious time - It's all gone overboard 
 Here is your calm down pill 
 I'll never be the same - it'll never be the same 
 With eyes open - my body's floating down the river 
 This life - What have I confined you for? It's all inside - it's all in silence 
 When the reaper gets its way 
 A million thoughts are swept away 
 And then you leave it all 
 You leave it all behind. 
 And maybe next time we'll meet again 
 And maybe I'll be less of a bitter man 
 When I feel more 
 I refuse to pay the ferryman - I'm so attached to my temple 
 He has to burn it down to get me 
 Ebony demon, shriek all you want - I'm not tagging along 
 The shade, the burning blackness - it is my protector 
 Fear before the fall - I can't grasp it all 
 But at least I'm trying 
 A light, a smoldering cinder 
 Getting colder, ashen 
 And letting all this go 
 I'm not letting go 
 I'm not really done here 
 I won't let go 
 Life's too short to be wrong 
 And maybe next time we'll meet again 
 And maybe I'll be less of a bitter man 
 And if I could do it all over again 
 I'd be the same man all over again 
 When I feel more.
########### Laments Of An Icarus ###########
Now it's always been a riddle 
 Misanthrope, you always pursued a valid reason 
 You know, to be wrong with a reason - you are what you are 
 But your ever present subliminal self bends the black - you sleep so tight 
 But dreamless - facing forward - dawn's edge, the supplement to destiny's ender 
 You smother all the words you have never said, with a mouth filled with empathy 
 Words can be an enemy - you can never say you're sorry 'cause you're a pretender 
 Unpretend - fall from grace - unconcealed - just a phase - summer's bruise - turn a wrench 
 Bottled thoughts - blind eye stare - look out of the window 
 You stare in the face of a widow - drink up, like a lover - you recreate all that's over 
 The turn of the tide - you're used up - just take it like a man, all you must do is confess 
 The truth is a knife - you are but one - one Straight answer. 
 What is it? Sculpture of an obsession - a sound so profound it sings you back to hell - the system's architecture 
 Frames the antidote's gift - winter - summer cycle moves erratic, follow me Aphrodite 
 Faithless - the one broken - the one who can bend a spoon with his will - bow down - here's my antidote 
 Priceless honest reaction 
 Come on, x2 
 Take it, x2 
 More. 
 Just another day in the rain, and a sure shot inside the game - walk the dead man directly to his grave 
 Without mourning, without nothing - be the same 
 Divide by numbers, all uncovered 
 Narrowed down from three to none my brother 
 And the nearest beacon cries "I'm sober" 
 But the truth remain unspoken 
 Cynic without anger 
 And a lover without passion 
 And a fighter with a complex 
 Worship your own cancer 
 And a lesson without meaning 
 It a lesson for the feeble 
 Branded by all-in-one frights 
 Antagonist, become my downfall 
 I'm just a man and I can't grasp it all.
########### One Eye For A Thousand ###########
Eyes - a thousand eyes waiting below the waves - because above the rain burns 
 My past becomes a lie 
 Goodbye sense of awareness - I drink adrenaline like mother's milk, it soothes me 
 Remove all that I trust, all I'm ashamed for, state of remission, I feed of the vulture 
 I'm left breathless - the Battle is lost 
 One step takes a thousand miles - one black circle where I expected sun 
 One blind spot - one eye for a thousand eyes 
 Where I begun: underwater I'm reborn 
 I got stuck in the nether on a lonely cloud, while the heat burns my feathers 
 We're all homeward bound - with a roar I dive down and I greet the seas 
 With words from an opiate verse. 
 I am waiting for 
 One hand to raise a thousand fists 
 One moment caught in a thousand times 
 One blind spot 
 One eye for a thousand eyes 
 One place to long for 
 And I surrender to my pride. 
 Goodbye. 
 These eyes have seen the abyss 
 This mouth has told a thousand lies 
 My hands are washed in guilt and 
 I face my own reflection's flight 
 What are you waiting for 
 You are left with nothing.
########### State Of Disobedience ###########
Meet your shadow-self 
 Your dynamic demon side 
 Pleased to meet you 
 Are you the rebel or the fool? 
 Inspiration or regression? 
 These dark waters are treacherous! 
 'Cause you never run, never will 
 Never dream fast enough 
 To beat the runner. 
 Jester's chronic laughter 
 Static discharge failure 
 Violence 
 Failsafe system running erratic 
 Cleanse me, I'm filthy 
 Heartbeats sing a song of change and 
 With sleep come the spoils 
 The nearing dawn yawns 
 With glistering teeth 
 My body shakes like the rattlesnakes tail. 
 Hear the bones 
 They rattle and shatter the silence 
 with words of comfort 
 Hear the spurs 
 The Breathing of the nameless horse 
 Spewing breath like fire 
 A momentary stirring of this poisoned air. 
 Like machines 
 We march in line 
 And fight our shadow 
 In the dark. 
 We are scattered and bewildered 
 Lights flicker in the eyes of the beast 
 We're all teeth, all primal, all hungry 
 We've never been so awake. 
 The moon is turning red you see 
 We're impatient 
 I'd kill for you. 
 Uncontrolled visions 
 Of seconds ticking away 
 It's not today 
 Like a lover you wait 
 I'm so tired, so damn tired 
 Dark is the moon 
 Clouding judgment 
 Hear the bones 
 They rattle and shatter the silence 
 with words of comfort 
 Hear the spurs 
 The Breathing of the nameless horse 
 Spewing breath like fire 
 A momentary stirring of this poisoned air 
 Take the best of what's to come 
 And cast it away 
 To never look back 
 Cloven hoofs echo in the dark 
 I'm bound to this dream 
 I'm so afraid 
 To break down and dissipate 
 I'm awake.
########### Storm Warning ###########
In pain there's a lesson 
 In blood there's a slithering form travelling 
 Through the veins, Through the body, amending 
 Burnt skin and broken bones 
 Don't deny it: we're all snakes at first 
 And then we change again. 
 We are the strangers of today 
 Reach out, forever in the dark. 
 In pain there's a moment 
 In blood there's a final story written 
 So the better you make me 
 I'm less man and more machine 
 Engaged in guessing, I'm lost for words 
 I'm never gone 
 I reach out for the serpent. 
 We are the strangers of today 
 Reach out for the serpent 
 Washing the dirt of ages away 
 Reach out for the serpent. 
 Ask yourself: is this worth a reversed evolution? 
 We're acting like a tidal wave 
 Crushing all that oppose us higher 
 Face the final legendary terminal new world disorder 
 Pain has hypnotizing voice and it calls your name higher. 
 So you want steady, you're gonna get steady 
 So you want unsteady, you're gonna get unsteady. 
 Look away, eyes turn black, it's raining now 
 It's angry now, clawing its way out 
 And then I shove the sun onto the light - the silence comes 
 My freedom comes from inside. 
 Tension relieved. 
 And I save myself from you - rescue me now 
 And you'll find your way back home to find what you look for. 
 Nothing, I said nothing 
 I guess I've always been stuck on the wrong side 
 Snakehead, you can't see me 
 Wherever i go, you go along 
 Break it, I said break it 
 Destruction will bring something new to the spectrum 
 Poison, suck the poison 
 Wherever you go, I go along.
########### Messengers ###########
Here I wander aimlessly 
 Divided like a restless sea 
 I remember messengers 
 Sifting through the boiling sand 
 Looking for a shaken hand 
 Wading through the mire 
 But never find what they desire. 
 Hear my voice calling. 
 A butterfly caught 
 Invisible wall 
 Keep away from light 
 I'm speechless 
 I'm fearless 
 I keep myself from running low on air. 
 I'm a passenger 
 I am just passing by 
 Walk with me 
 I'm a passenger 
 I'm not supposed to be here 
 Roads in one direction 
 All lead to where I'll be. 
 Here I wonder endlessly 
 A story told uneasily 
 I remember messengers 
 Smell the scent of every season 
 How dark they might be 
 This old monster has its reasons 
 I am finally free 
 Stay with me now. 
 See what you have done, creator 
 There's no great escape 
 Still hunger - I'm forsaken 
 I turn to the messengers.
########### To Erase A Lifetime ###########
Here's my only dream 
 While I breathe dopamine 
 My creature's cunning 
 It walks the road between sense and amphetamine. 
 Clearly an ominous presence 
 Seraphs belong only to the ones who wait 
 I can feel it combine me 
 Merging all of my instincts with the withering beast. 
 We dance around in a ring and suppose 
 But the secret sits in the middle and knows 
 Skies are ashen, dim summer stench 
 Uncontrollable aesthetics relapse this twilight as dawn. 
 Faster, suppressor, a silent storm approaching 
 Behold a black-chalked figurine - it speaks to me in tongues 
 I resist my dislocation 
 Automatic integration of forgotten flaws and imperfections 
 Amplification of this endlessness 
 These words form a knife of cold 
 And pierce the heart of the unloving echoes of departure 
 My will bends as a twig in the wind. 
 Decipher unwritten laws of coded existence 
 I'm naked in the cold. 
 Strangely amused by conformity 
 Caught with a strange desire 
 I'm both promise and lie. 
 Build to receive 
 Conductor of hours 
 A clockwork 
 A grim device built to undo 
 Erase a lifetime 
 Creator of ends. 
 Now death sets a thing significant 
 The eye had hurried by 
 Years become a second when thoughts collide with memories 
 The stitches stopped themselves 
 And then it was put among the dust. 
 The center of self 
 Equation of life 
 The less you resist 
 The less you've erased. 
 I fear the ghosts of all that would be 
 There is no closure 
 I heed the call of millions of others who fight the giant 
 One second alone has brought me thunder.
########### Arms Of The Sea ###########
Man, born 
 Locked down by the water 
 Hear the rustle spat out from the corner 
 As we are thrown 
 Right into the arms of the sea 
 Sheer bliss 
 The dense cold collides 
 The cliffs loomed up in the distance 
 As they exhale, inhale 
 We must be born anew 
 To paint our portraits like the way we are 
 We must learn to breathe again 
 To reach the core of patterns in our souls 
 Maybe we are something we are not 
 It gives us a reason to be 
 The spine of our soulless approach 
 That gives us a reason to die 
 Grand your light to the sun 
 And turn your back on the shells 
 At the shores, the sea 
 Sow your seeds into the soil 
 And recall the ideas that we shared 
 In the years that we spent to progress 
 Oversee to be free, mesmerize 
 And try to embrace the arms that come forth 
 By the days of resurgence stream 
 Change me 
 Drain all blood from the wounds 
 And sleep your woes, slumbering 
 Shed your skin and swim 
 Right into the arms of the sea 
 The waves lifting, rising from the oceans 
 The undertow breathes again 
 As we are thrown 
 Right into the arms of the sea 
 The dense cold collides 
 The cliffs loomed up in the distance 
 As they exhale, inhale 
 Maybe we are something we are not 
 That gives us a reason to be 
 The spine of our mental approach 
 That gives us a reason to live
########### Black Horses Stampede ###########
The wind, it unfolds me 
 It takes me to the fields of no conceit 
 A thousand piercing voices 
 Cutting through the white noise as it 
 Drains me for I am 
 Merely a cloud that is drifting 
 By the trail of raindrops 
 Falling on their frozen faces 
 Something inside 
 That stops bleeding from my eyes 
 My eyes ache from outside 
 I must resist 
 Me flesh is weak 
 This spoken word that guides my blood 
 Sipping through the noise 
 Approaching like 
 Black horses stampede 
 My heart beats with sorrow 
 It cries and fades away 
 Find me a way to pull through 
 To obey my reason 
 For the times that I came 
 To the point that I couldn't believe 
 Chasing the waves of decay 
 I will follow the path to release 
 There is nothing that is holding me down 
 I can feel it is time to leave 
 Voices speak and echo in 
 Empty beds of a salted sea 
 Unfolding winds ongoing 
 As I stare through the window 
 I have been drawn by the myth of the pure 
 No fear, it takes me on the winds of unknowing 
 Like fallout through fire I will dance on the wire 
 Which will lead me to legends that we all so admire 
 As we crave for the future I speak my desires 
 So these tormenting thoughts will commit suicide
########### Reaching Home ###########
The ocean wants me 
 Never had to look under water 
 Has it been ruled 
 The never ending current pulls me through 
 Waiting, waiting 
 How it has been flowing since I was a boy 
 Swimming, lightning 
 Coming home, I am going home 
 Wash it all away, end up strong 
 These eyes have grown, these eyes have shown 
 Watching the horizon, hoping for 
 The cliffs to rise above the shore 
 The tide rises far above 
 The sky fades into the sea 
 The awareness slowly ebbs away 
 As light surely will find me 
 As calm as inside a womb 
 As the skies are filled 
 With shades of gloom 
 The watchers of time have foretold 
 That this life will find its way back home 
 Even a man who fights the cold 
 Fears the depths of his own soul 
 Under the stars that share his light 
 Sinking slow and reaching home
########### Sanguine Draws The Oath ###########
Turning away from everything that is near 
 Trying to fill the void that appears so clear 
 Could I see it coming - consuming all of me 
 It is time to decide - this is right where I stand 
 Could I just read the rhymes until I feel nothing more 
 Then it tends to be so easily - I will fade 
 These nerve-stretching seizures - phlegmatic to the physics 
 A desecration of the intellect 
 They are preaching their aesthetics 
 Waiting for this moment to redirect the pain 
 To make the forecast be compromising for 
 Parading in this pitch-black vulturous scene I will break 
 The oath of all restraint 
 Dream, before the time arrives 
 The earth will awake - anxious state of mind 
 Leaving this body motionless 
 Turning black once more - the eyes are wide open 
 "The great black yonder 
 Is pelting icicles upon my nerves 
 I melt them to rain 
 The water that flows out of the horizon 
 A clammy sensation of my persistence" 
 Casting the hunger for neurotic seizures 
 Serving the syndrome 
 Shedding the anger of everlasting darkness 
 Feeding the illusion 
 Despair is my own generous gesture to death 
 Turning away from everything that is near 
 Trying to fill the void that appears so clear 
 A seismic shock, unleashing revolution 
 Shedding skin, down drift exclamations 
 Hypnagogic state, endless lucid dreaming 
 Perpetual sleep, as we share the conclusion of 
 Shedding the anger of everlasting darkness 
 Feeding the illusion
########### Consonant Hemispheres ###########
The rain has come 
 He surrenders to his fate 
 It is hiding him 
 From the sounds of his mental state 
 And the rain falls 
 And the rain pours down 
 It is fair to say 
 That he drifted 
 On the salt of the open sea 
 And the words that bleed in his mouth 
 Carry him, drag him to the deep 
 Heave your arms 
 Caught adrift 
 Embrace the shade 
 The drama is torn asunder 
 Thus I fall inside my fate 
 Waiting for the fever 
 And I will sing to my crusade 
 Between the barren and fruitful 
 I got lost in the daily grind 
 There is no way that supports my 
 Dark conceptions to unwind 
 I am the art for the people 
 The apple of their crying eyes 
 Missionaire for the seeking, now 
 Chewing their lives with contempt 
 Like a stormfront that he precedes 
 It is the sound of the dreamer that screams 
 Bashing clocks he had always wondered 
 But never spoke of 
 It is the strength, the weakness 
 And the perfect in between 
 The strength 
 The weakness 
 And the perfect in between 
 Facing everything that he walked upon 
 The eye had hurried by 
 Compromising the smallest 
 Fractions of a particle
########### Singularity ###########
This world has changed 
 Before our eyes - we can't control 
 Waiting to find 
 Waiting here with nothing more to say 
 Goodbye to all I have said 
 Was waiting for decay 
 Here I am, waving to the waves 
 Catch the dream before we are 
 Left inside and everything is gone 
 Catch the dream before someone else is 
 Setting forth and illusive state of war 
 The shimmering flocks of shadows that 
 Surround the walls we are looking at 
 Mark of silence 
 It tells me to hide 
 It hides the divide 
 Me versus man 
 Bear the silence 
 Tell me, mother: how can I turn back old times 
 Maybe we are all asleep and die inside to taste 
 The urge to feel so much more 
 Closing all my windows to embrace 
 "Our identities are stories 
 With holes in their language 
 Slumbering, at the height of what 
 Could have been synchronicity or 
 Parallels in multiple dimensions 
 "Can we find any reference 
 In this abstract color field 
 This ambivalence, this dualism 
 Can we see the details of a bigger entity 
 What is the antidote 
 To the triviality of modern life" 
 Find the words to completion 
 Take me there, where I belong 
 Fallen into harsh delusion 
 Drawing circles to my illusion 
 To reflect me and my diffusion 
 Waves keep lashing down on the old shores 
 Sunlight sails the soothing silence 
 I am spitting letters 
 Paraphrased in sand 
 My words are set on fire
########### Minor Earth, Major Skies ###########
Cursed we are above all contentment 
 Breaking the evolution 
 Our history swept away 
 We are shattered by our prey 
 Lushing, spoiling 
 Staring through the eyes of decay 
 Comfort is losing contrast in this light 
 Ignorance eradicating 
 This life draws to an end 
 We need to find the strength 
 To put the earth in motion 
 Behold, ignorance is our new messiah 
 Abundant rays, all light from the sun 
 Gaze into the fire 
 And the soothing winds 
 In our eyes, in our nerves 
 As our colors are fading out 
 Just like birds in the storm 
 So let the squall come, waking us 
 "As tidal waves hit solid ground no permanence is ours 
 We are a wave that flows to fit whatever form it finds" 
 Minor Earth, major skies 
 The summit of the syntaxis of all life 
 Is eroding along the path 
 The great ocean road 
 And its walls that always change 
 Are still rising up 
 The distribution of energy 
 In dissonant directions 
 A shift of paradigms 
 Are these enough answers to our questions 
 As we dive 
 We might see a new dawn 
 This life that carries on 
 Promenading through the storm 
 This everlasting chase 
 The ways that seize the days 
 Predicted to amaze 
 Serenity will pave 
 The inner state of grace 
 As tidal waves break down 
 Consciousness collides 
 No permanence is ours
########### Stoic Resignation ###########
I see the light 
 So bright, overthrown 
 The life of a caesar will end 
 Again, the mourning in his eyes 
 Life will not feed on him 
 Strong asthenia 
 He trades his mind 
 The answers he needs 
 In the eye of the emperor 
 Relinquish his fate 
 Burying the beacon in time 
 See, open my eyes and stare 
 But who am I to focus them 
 I see his mind burnt down 
 The beauty of burden 
 Do not underestimate the enemy's gaze 
 The answers are there 
 Life will not feed on him 
 It is real 
 Focus my eyes again 
 But why should I open them 
 Only when time collides 
 Hide and the savior relents 
 Now that everything is reclaimed 
 And I don't own a thing 
 Once, the life that has been led 
 Needs to be revised 
 Every step along the way 
 Has been a stone to bear 
 Whether the path will still lead me 
 Followed it will be 
 There will be relief 
 There will be light towards the end 
 Strolling through the open fields 
 And nothing will impend 
 No more time to make amends 
 The boundary here awaits 
 Lingering with a head held high 
 I face to seal my fate 
 And here I stand alone 
 For the fire took 
 What had been revived 
 Present time is over 
 Now think, can you take this 
 When everything is so pitiful 
 Did you ever know 
 It all could come down on you 
 As one struggles to control 
 Foreclosure ends before you know 
 I feel the light 
 I can feel it down on my skin 
 Got to face the dark 
 To survive in the light 
 Let go of this world 
 Take it down 
 Bring it all down
########### Foreclosure ###########
Here it falls again 
 Exile for the damned 
 Waking the yesterdays 
 Wading through the mind 
 Take the foe from the eyes of a god 
 And fly on the wings of a chariot 
 Life will take what you gather 
 Curse you and play dead 
 Reverse and reset 
 Again and again
########### Sketches From A Motionless Statue ###########
Can a man stop to realize 
 There is nothing to stand for 
 Reach out, our minds combined 
 Bonded by thoughts 
 Here is the secret world 
 We are the same way 
 Keep it off your side 
 We are the same way 
 Waking up and see the dance around 
 Of a broken harmony 
 They are feeding off the winters 
 In our heads 
 Can't make us wondering 
 For everything is much the same 
 We are still being tied by 
 Shame, like fighting underwater 
 Motionless, for we all know 
 We all shall burn, heavenless 
 Blame me for every 
 Lacerated actions and efforts 
 Manage the endeavour 
 I pledge the open source 
 Conduct the overlapping 
 Elements of time 
 Waking the yesterdays 
 Wading through the mind 
 Waiting to escape the drifted sands 
 Breathe, the open wounds 
 That is what it feeds 
 Statement to the old remorse 
 Consolate, eat the flesh 
 I can't take 
 What will be the link 
 Breathe, the open source 
 That is what it greeds 
 Statement to the old remorse 
 Contrition, harsh regret 
 I can't take 
 What will be the link 
 Waking the yesterdays 
 Wading through the mind 
 Waiting to escape the drifted sands 
 Break the chain 
 Elevation of the sewers 
 The waking of the waters 
 The heritage from the fathers 
 To their daughters to renew us 
 We are disciples 
 We live our own way 
 We are persuaders 
 Defend our own space 
 Here is the secret world 
 We are the same way 
 Keep it in your mind 
 We are the same way
########### Oceans Collide ###########
These mystifying thoughts – obstructing the objective 
 Enclosing on the light – trying to flee 
 From it's opposite 
 When walls are collapsing – earth is convulsing 
 Skies are falling – and oceans collide 
 Reality, phasing in and out 
 Foundations that crumble – the ground is eroding 
 Asphyxiating air – and oceans collide 
 Desperately searching – for answers to unravel 
 This tormenting – disputed point 
 Avoiding debris – escaping the substance 
 Nomadically wandering on the boulevard of ruptured chimeras 
 Stumbling on a crooked paving stone 
 Resembling the perjury – withholding to take measures 
 In the right direction 
 While everything upon us is raging before the eyes 
 We can't acknowledge where it is 
 Where we should reside 
 Keep moving – stay focused – look forward 
 If push comes to shove we'll be turning the tides 
 Carrying the weight – lifting the shades trying to face 
 A conscious state, phasing in and out 
 A fierce but effective approach 
 Subconsciously grasping 
 Any shape or form which opens up my universe 
 While standing in potentially unexplored territory 
 Stumbling on a crooked pining stone 
 Resembling the perjury 
 Withholding m take measures in the right direction 
 Subconsciously grasping the pieces that will forge into 
 The universe I'm standing in today 
 Subconsciously grasping
########### New Horizons ###########
Hold the calm breeze today 
 The congregation stays 
 The tired fall asleep 
 As their time is swept away 
 Their view starts to fade 
 As clear minds give in to reason 
 But we found a way to welcome new times 
 Asking questions that will change our lives 
 This is the time to turn the tide 
 We are going to feel this 
 We are going to be this 
 Rise and go against this entity 
 Rise above the sky 
 All we can do now is face it 
 We are done hiding like faceless 
 Mindless minions 
 Always driven to malice 
 Bovini 
 We're to adjust our behaviour 
 I can feel there is something, someway, somehow 
 That can help disestablish this hierarchy 
 Finding a way to welcome new times 
 The fear of questions fades 
 Eyes can save themselves 
 Just as long as they don't look down 
 Open minded with both feet on the ground 
 Maybe guiding life using reason to clear the line of sight 
 Will be our way to welcome new times 
 Asking questions that will change our lives 
 This is the time to turn the tide 
 We are going to feel this 
 We are going to be this 
 Rise and go against this entity 
 Rise above the sky 
 Face it 
 We are done hiding like faceless 
 Mindless minions 
 Always driven to malice 
 Bovini 
 We're to adjust our behaviour 
 I can feel there is something, someway, somehow 
 That can help disestablish this hierarchy 
 Finding a way to welcome new times 
 The fear of questions fades 
 We are standing on the verge of a new horizon 
 Welcome the new day
########### Shaping A Single Grain Of Sand ###########
Starting with the sound – the sound of a drop 
 Shaping a single grain of sand – seeping through time 
 Draining the enigma – the hunt is on 
 And as fear dictates the design – for the grand escape 
 And it's slowly breaking down the branches 
 Breaking through – negative energy 
 Turn the flow – forcing this gravity to its knees 
 A crumbling statue decimates the posture 
 Leaving but a shadow of the former self 
 The eyes turning from crystal to blur 
 Revealing but a fraction of the brightness they once had 
 Spiraling – further into the deep 
 Losing grip – tearing this soul away at the seams 
 Breaking free – from this energy 
 Turn the flow – breaking through 
 Tearing this soul away at the seams 
 Forcing this gravity to its knees 
 Circuits overload – flooded with dopamine 
 Receptors malfunction – dendritic trees wither and turn to dust 
 Washed away by a drop – shaping a single grain of sand 
 The price paid becomes irrelevant 
 Reflections on actions become impossible 
 The descent continues 
 As the ties to the surface grow thinner and thinner 
 You're disconnected 
 Sunken in deep slumber – this silence soothes my thought 
 There's no stronger connection to ourselves than to be alone 
 Dragging water into the sea – throwing fire at the sun 
 Breathing air into the wind – digging up earth before the avalanche 
 I'm breaking through 
 Washed away by a drop 
 Shaping a single grain of sand 
 Seeping through time 
 Leaving a 
 Drained enigma
########### Illuminate The Trail ###########
The heat melts my wings 
 They are not mine 
 I haven't earned them yet 
 This fantasy still lives 
 Virtues come to mind 
 They are forsaken 
 The only thing that matters is 
 Reflection of choices made under stress 
 Saying sorry only mends a broken pride 
 Taking actions is the only way 
 That we can win this fight 
 Cause and reaction as primary fuel for curiosity 
 As there is no final question 
 And no final answer 
 Doubt but do not fear 
 And you will find truth 
 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder 
 But it might not be as you've always imagined 
 Do not be afraid 
 Always question everything 
 Empirically revoke impossibilities and embrace 
 Go find the answers 
 Let me clarify that 
 Knowledge comes from questions 
 Illuminate the trail 
 For generations to come 
 Lift the obstructing veil 
 Create transparent vision 
 Eliminate the boundaries 
 Imagine the unimaginable 
 And broaden the horizon 
 Always question everything 
 For these are true revelations 
 And this is the time for change 
 Our pathetic excuse for a civilization needs this 
 Just one enlightening thought 
 Amongst billions can make a difference 
 The past is evidence for not this fact alone 
 Our secluded procreation 
 Fails to see 
 What is in front of their magnified eyes 
 As knowledge floods humanity 
 While leaving our common sense behind 
 So let evidence guide you 
 And feel the weight being lifted 
 Off your shoulders 
 Breathe freely 
 Making it easy to keep 
 An open mind 
 One enlightening thought 
 Is all it takes to move forward 
 And leave the cloud of unknowing behind 
 And you will find truth 
 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder 
 But it might not be as you've always imagined 
 Do not be afraid
########### Erosion ###########
Secluding the infant's reliance 
 Self-indulgence is reigning 
 As the redundant has been denied 
 Standing vast since adolescence 
 Still susceptible like a nursling 
 Desperately longing for the roots to grow deeper 
 But they can't be reached as concrete walls 
 Have been built around them 
 Solely walking the earth 
 Searching for affirmation 
 As the heart knows 
 Heredity can't flee from its precedent 
 The benighted progenitor 
 Vigorous still 
 Inattentive of what his actions composed 
 The trees are saving themselves 
 With branches reaching towards the skies 
 While the powers of our great mother are trying to smite them down 
 She's hearing their cries 
 Vainly pleading to keep the trunks strong and whole 
 As tribes need the soil to be nourishing 
 The shepherd reverses rolls 
 As the wolf becomes the prey 
 Flames arise from the ashes 
 Left behind by the conflict 
 While the convict is wearing its mask like a Proteus 
 Denying the torment that has been inflicted 
 Leading his life like a Proteus 
 As no history lies behind him
########### The Fourth Prime ###########
Seven virtues 
 And seven sins alike 
 They represent our own creation 
 Like seven man made wonders 
 Glorious in concept 
 Subjected to our own devastation 
 We recognize occurrences 
 And categorize our surroundings 
 While giving meaning to words 
 All conceived from the urge to understand 
 And now used against those who don't 
 The fourth prime has its story to tell 
 So much meaning bestowed upon one number 
 A single word 
 All because the world has to make sense 
 Seven fatal flaws 
 Encouraged by seven continents 
 Lived by through seven eras of time 
 All leading to the downfall of man 
 The question is not how but when? 
 Signs of adaptation surround us in numbers 
 Recognized and described by man-made words 
 Endless theories of mutating evolving revolving spirals 
 Cannot convince that change should be next in line 
 Abiding the law of gravity 
 Hovering into nothingness 
 Accelerating down the scales of coexistence 
 Beyond the point where no man lives for himself 
 Seven fatal flaws 
 Encouraged by seven continents 
 Lived by through seven eras of time 
 All leading to the downfall of man 
 All conceived from the urge to understand 
 And now used against those who don't 
 The question is not how but when? 
 Seven fatal flaws 
 Encouraged by seven continents 
 Lived by through seven eras of time 
 All leading to the downfall of man 
 The question is not how but when?
########### Timeless ###########
Last time I have discovered 
 Roads to my loneliness 
 An ocean divided 
 Like red seas in fairy tales 
 We're always running away 
 Away from our deepest fears 
 Hiding in shadows 
 Until the path is clear 
 Red seas in fairy tales 
 Our path have crossed many times 
 Last time I have discovered 
 We run 
 Hiding 
 Until the path is clear 
 I heard you crawling 
 Carrying your burden 
 Down the yearning hills 
 We set a flame the beacons 
 Envious whispers 
 I heard you crawling 
 Carrying your burden 
 Down the yearning hills 
 We set a flame the beacons 
 Envious whispers 
 Burning behind me 
 I'm not keeping pace 
 Straight forward focused eyes 
 I'm not keeping pace 
 A scorching, soothing fire's embrace

########### Dots ###########
Children... we stand and fight 
 Message... we stand and fight 
 Children... we stand and fight 
 All these days are numbered, lets play the waiting game 
 One by one the fallen will get to take the blame 
 Elegant, all of them but something's missing, it's more than just happiness 
 They feel cheated, all of them, everyone 
 They feel defeated, it's serious suffering, when will this change? 
 Boy, you just shove it 
 Game for a feeling 
 Your time is coming 
 Ever closer now 
 Slowly we move in, and so we start again 
 Only our finest can hold them in the rain 
 Blinding white noise. Times have changed 
 Blinding white noise. Times must change 
 So hard bending light, someone tell me how to get through the TV? 
 How to get through the damn hole? 
 Once again I begin losing all of my senses
########### Order 66 ###########
Hold on, don't lose the order 
 You know it's okay to live and learn 
 How long would you suffer before you sacrifice the sun? 
 How many times have I been here? 
 I could never tell 
 Playing with fire feels sincere 
 Even though I'm in hell 
 I won't fight the one 
 I turn away from order 
 So strong, you learn to love her 
 Like a child so unaware 
 How come we all recover? 
 You know it's okay to be compared 
 How much death have I been near? 
 Far too much to tell 
 Nothing scarred me more than fear 
 I step forth to tell 
 I won't fight the one 
 I turn away from order 
 We reverse the cell again 
 I won't fight the one 
 I turn away from order
########### Catharsis ###########
Behind the walls we seem to know 
 We have faith in too many things and we just don't know what to choose 
 We have control over everything and we could stand to lose it all 
 I believe we are a supernova. Born onto a dying star 
 What if we had known, but what if we were never meant to know? 
 Behind our star 
 What if we had known, but what if we were never meant to know? 
 We die stranded here 
 Would we survive, or would we die? 
 Behind our star 
 We want this to be over 
 We believe in so many things that we just don't know what to do 
 We have faith in too many things that we just don't know what to choose 
 Supernova, tell us once again, will we ever know? 
 Tell us who we are 
 Born onto a dying star 
 Home again 
 When will I be home again? 
 We want this to be over 
 Tell us who we are 
 We want this to be over, although we need it so badly
########### Night ###########
I fell into a dream 
 Nothing is what it seems 
 I fell into a dream 
 Nothing is what it seems 
 How do they know? 
 I fell into a dream 
 I fell into a dream 
 I'm at peace
########### Aurora ###########
I still miss you, how do you fare? 
 An angel came to me, pulling me back again 
 With a loving despair 
 So everybody dies 
 Everybody drifts away 
 Everybody dies 
 I feel lonely, come home swiftly 
 Even though I tried holding you back again 
 I'm still slipping away 
 Pray for the love, for the need to be free 
 For someone you can hold 
 So everybody dies 
 Everybody drifts away 
 Everybody dies
########### Celestial ###########
I'll never know how something so alive and fine 
 Can see behind the sun 
 I'll never know how someone so beautiful 
 Could pine away 
 Cry...we're free again, Celestial 
 I don't know why you can't fight me, resist, abide by fists 
 Back to back and it's time you knew now that this is all you had 
 When we are rejected we lose our way, we're terrified 
 When we are protected the stars shine light into our lives 
 I lost my way, I'm fine 
 I lost my way 
 I lost my way 
 I don't know and I don't care 
 Cry...we're free again, Celestial 
 I fell down undiscovered 
 I'm broken waiting for this endless day to come 
 Please don't turn off the lights we're having the time of our lives 
 I don't know why you can't fight me, resist, abide by fists 
 Back to back and it's time you knew now that this is all you had 
 As life burns out age old earth rolls on 
 Lights fade out, away 
 As daylight dies the world will turn it's back on you 
 As daylight dies the stars will shine for you 
 Don't want to feel like this anymore 
 Don't want to lose my way again
########### Maeva ###########
Alice making me pay with temptation 
 I stray far from wonderland to a place of war 
 White rabbit suggests that I take a few pills 
 And drink some shit that I've never even seen before 
 Fields of green and hearts of stone surrounding me 
 Make for glorious undertones 
 A pack of cards thrown in my hand 
 Forgiving castle walls just turn to sand 
 Are you following me as I try to explain? 
 Mad Hatter is here, messing with my brain 
 Are you curious now? Dis-functioning in the clouds 
 I spent far too long milling in this drain 
 Fields of green and hearts of stone surrounding me 
 Make for glorious undertones 
 A pack of cards thrown in my hand 
 Forgiving castle walls just turn to sand 
 Don't lose the fight and look back 
 It's time to dance 
 We're alive, come together and you'll know this is India! 
 It's so damn hard to let go 
 But take a chance 
 And survive, come together, embrace life this is India! 
 Holding out a hand hoping I'll believe her, that I'll understand. 
 Tell me isn't this the truth, choosing to ignore her, what if it was you? 
 Tell me how do we get so wrapped up in our own world? 
 Kill all the lights, this is the last time. This is the last time everything is grey. 
 Everything is grey, everything is grey. 
 And you know they got us on the run, killing as life goes on 
 Same old story, yeah? Same old story. 
 I can't find myself, I'm sure I live for something but as 
 My minds eye will tell these little fingers are disgusting not by choice 
 I'll think of something but I'll save some for myself 
 Boys don't believe, don't believe, don't believe it 
 Think about, think about, think about it 
 Don't believe, don't believe. 
 Be careful what you say because anyone could be listening

Lines. The question's left alone 
 I will hold on to this for as long as I remember your face 
 For the love of my brother 
 You've taken time. My friend. My providence 
 Take the time to talk 
 Walk with me a while 
 Break a promise 
 Throw an arm around 
 Seize the day 
 I watched you go inside 
 Take your name this time 
 Watch me do it 
 Let me break the tide 
 Breaking water 
 My hands are still 
 The words are one to shake 
 Shiver me 
 The three us will move 
 Water demon 
 The names are on my hand 
 I write your name again 
 Sever honor 
 Being by myself 
 Playing time 
 The game is ill. I stand here conquered 
 These lines on paper won't mean shit if I don't let them go 
 The ink of sanity. Drained upon my guilt 
 I promise to 
 Hold on to your pictures 
 Never take what you're given. Never mend on the bend 
 Do away with your resolve 
 Lines on paper fading. I've given into this mess 
 Take the time to talk 
 Walk with me a while 
 Break a promise 
 Throw an arm around 
 Seize the day 
 I watched you go inside 
 Take your name this time 
 Watch me do it 
 Let me break the tide 
 Breaking water 
 My hands are fucking still 
 The words are one to shake 
 Shiver me 
 The three us will move 
 Water demon 
 The names are on my hand 
 I write your name again

 Never spoken. Never scarred. On me

Catch. Take it and run. These words were built to hold you down. Never obey. 
 Spread your toes, let it burn. 
 Feel the wind. You've given in to the desolate march of chaos. Flying. 
 Dig into the ground below. 
 Take the pill. You're digging a place so secret. Lies will fall. You will soar. 
 Part the wind. When you've burned your world around you, bridges are all that (remain). 
 Run. Push. Away. Into the sky. 
 The ground. Propels. Your will. 
 And I hate 
 Defining the winds 
 And I hate 
 You run to fly. 
 Lay back and observe the mess you've made of the children in your mind. 
 When you're running at those speeds, you don't fall. 
 You collide 
 Catch. Take it and run. You've armed yourself to take the sky. Break the cast. 
 Spread your toes, let it burn. 
 Feel the wind. Deliver the words you'll never forget. Silent. Brooding. 
 Dig into the ground below. 
 Take the pill. They'll never see your going. 
 Lies will fall. 
 You will dig. 
 Part the win. When you've burned your world around you, bridges remain. 
 When you burn. The bridges. The water will rise. 
 The ground. Propels. The sky. 
 And I hate 
 Defining the wind 
 And I hate 
 You run to fly.
########### Insurrection ###########
Seek the skin that contains the name. Never revealed. 
 Spit the maker. Hold the key to change. Be the I in You. 
 Dig in and stroke the seed of that which you fear. Call it your own and leash the bastard 
 Cradle all the imperfections you know. 
 Watch them take control. 
 Keep the glitch close to your heart and never let them know the answers. 
 Let this imbalance be your first. Falling through. 
 Explode inwards and contain the fragments within the mile of skin 
 You will feel the green move within you 
 You're marked with the strain of the snake 
 Spit at the maker. It's a fostered lie. Never fail you own. Prevail. 
 Let this imbalance will be your first. 
 Insurrection 
 To slay. The blindness. 
 Fall in line. 
 You will conceive the truth to be the one you could never be. 
 And you will push the mask away to take the form of the snake. 
 The breaking of skin will bring the dawn of birth and learning. 
 And you will shed the form they spat upon the healing. 
 And you will push away the mask to take the form of the snake. 
 This beautiful green 
 Will run through your veins to essence of the soul. 
 Essence of the soul. 
 Essence of the soul. 
 Push. Cesserate. Reign. Snake. 
 The essence of the soul. 
 Reign. Snake 
 To slay the fucking blindness. 
 Reign. Snake. 
 Snake.

Come close to me, promise everything, don’t tell a 
 soul, let’s just begin. Stiletto tied and bound to me, 
 the sound of silk and skin to skin. A close embrace, 
 a lusting grin, entangled in a web of lust and sin. 
 A kiss of death, the speed of sound, you’ve come to 
 take my innocence. 
 Don’t hesitate, your gift sets me free. And the biting 
 feeds the lust in me. 
 No thanks to this state of undress, you drag me in 
 hand on my chest. the beat of life will satisfy, poison 
 lips I won’t deny. A close embrace, a lusting grin, 
 entangled in a web of lust and sin. A kiss of death, 
 the speed of sound. Do you feel the beat of life? 
 forgive me, oh won’t you forgive me? 
 Don’t hesitate, your gift sets me free. And the biting 
 feeds the lust in me. 
 You’re slipping through my fingertips, you bring me 
 to my knees. It’s over and I’m cold. 
 In this fine allure, keep it to yourself. I need your 
 love. In this fen allure, the biting feeds a lusting, 
 beating heart. I trust in you and carelessly strip you 
 down. Living, living by the words l’amour. 
 Playing by the rules no more. Living by the words 
 l’amour, l’amour, l’amour. dangerous eyes, 
 tempting sighs…keep them to yourself. 
 Strip me down. 
 You’re so warm and slipping through my fingertips, 
 you bring me to my knees. It’s over now. 
 And I won’t hesitate, your gift sets me free. And the 
 biting feeds the lust in me.
########### Evolution ###########
I stare into the night 
 Passing shadows under glistening light 
 When you light that flame 
 I see visions dancing in your eyes 
 Let me burn 
 We are created by the energy 
 So if this is evolution 
 And infinite possibilities 
 Let me burn 
 This is evolution 
 Look into the sky 
 See the hunter hiding from the light 
 When you hear the sound of rain and thunder 
 Run into the wild 
 You don't need to envy me 
 'cause you got everything you need 
 Take my hand and follow me 
 Don't be afraid 
 It's just communication 
 You'll never have it all 
 But it is in our nature 
 The need for more 
 You don't need to fight it 
 Just let it go 
 There'll be no limitations 
 Take me far 
 Burn 
 Burn 
 Burn 
 Let me burn 
 I'm the energy 
 This is evolution 
 And infinite possibilities 
 Let me burn 
 This is evolution 
 Don't be afraid 
 It's just communication 
 You'll never have it all 
 But it is in our nature 
 The need for more 
 You don't need to fight it 
 Just let it go 
 There'll be no limitations
########### Idle Minds ###########
You rose above, transcended all, now I suffer and 
 take the fall. I gave you all that love could give, but 
 karma called. Scrub up, operate on this blood red 
 stone. Here we go! I try not complicate but this is 
 not a celebration now. No, I’m moving on. 
 You rose above, transcended all, now I suffer and 
 take the fall. I gave you all that love could give, but 
 karma called. Who, who are you, if I can be so bold? 
 Oh, did you let it slip to the ones who came 
 before? We live in an isolated, unforgiving world. 
 Everyone deserves to be righteous, free 
 and satisfied. If I can do it myself, then you can do 
 it yourself. Every time I fly away I leave my body 
 behind. 
 Asphyxiated on this cold hard floor, you are the 
 ivy and you take control. Please let me go, release 
 me from your stronghold. I see the consequence 
 of open doors. I get the sense that I’ve been here 
 before. I see the consequence of open doors. 
 This honest lust has made me want you more. 
 Here stands my guilt intent, pretending to let go 
 here for the final time. Statue of a broken line. 
 Pretending to let go here for the final time. You 
 are the ivy that suffocates these crooked limbs and 
 these rusting walls. Idle minds forget the past. 
 Idle minds are doomed to pass. 
 Don’t be afraid, be victorious. This sudden urge for a 
 needless thought. Close the door, the night is ours. 
 The need for change is in us all. 
 Don’t be afraid.
########### Miracle ###########
Weak and feeble, poor mind. Overcome, pack of 
 lies. Lonely world. Future sound. 
 Stay asleep, there's so far to go. All I ask is please 
 don’t fill your life with treasure and nothing more. 
 Never let your temper take control, never choose 
 to love somebody then sell your soul. 
 I’ll wait for you, and you’ll find it so mysterious. All 
 the beauty you will discover. All the stillness seems 
 so serious. Dive deep into the colours. 
 Stay asleep, there's so far to go. All I ask is please 
 don’t fill your life with treasure and nothing more. 
 Never let your temper take control, never choose 
 to love somebody then sell your soul. 
 Stuck inside this daydream once again. I remember 
 dancing vividly under innocent midnight skies and 
 street lights. I keep waking up. 
 As I sink into the sand my time has come, and I’m 
 waiting for the endless tide to come. I give this 
 lonely world future sound. 
 Pretending not to feel like a liar. I am. Pretending 
 not to feel like a cynical and wretched soul. I give 
 this world future sound, oh little boy. 
 If what I see is real, then you are my miracle.
########### Halogen ###########
Now wake me up and I’ll follow on 
 And run around with these familiar faces 
 Discover revelation 
 This evanescent blue, I’ll find you 
 This information is confirmation 
 That we’re set to lose it all 
 Raise up the world 
 Rain down your souls 
 This information, this evanescent blue 
 Is confirmation that I know I can’t be wrong 
 Satisfaction left for dead 
 Armor for my weakened head 
 Separate to devotion 
 I recognize that weary head 
 Nothing to be left unsaid 
 Never before, ever did I 
 Ever have that feeling 
 Rain down, pour my soul 
 Rain down, pour my soul 
 Back and forth, back and forth 
 Straight into my arms 
 If you’re waiting for love 
 Then don’t do it alone 
 Back and forth, back and forth 
 Straight into my arms 
 Where did we go wrong? 
 Where did we go wrong, so wrong? 
 Where did we go wrong? 
 Cause this has gone out of control 
 Where did we go wrong? 
 Cause this has gone out of control
########### New Devil ###########
Time to escape, time to breathe, but to cast a 
 shadow here, you have come to devour every part 
 of me. Isolated, oscillating in a universal, constant 
 stream. You are the voice inside my mind and 
 behind a hundred violent tendencies. 
 Come to me. Don’t deny I am your new devil 
 merge with me. Be as one. I am your new devil. 
 You pull me eight feet under. The smell of sulfur 
 is getting stronger. I can feel it in my eyes as the 
 parody subsides. 
 The air turned to ash, ash turned to stone, stone 
 eroded. Lovingly, every eye on me was gone. Shells 
 made of glass, tokens of love. Memories worth 
 caring for ; in the end they matter not. 
 I bend time, always behind. Forever there in the 
 dark, you hide. 
 Give in to me, die within us. The world will never 
 be a better place.
########### Patience ###########
Sleep… stay asleep. 
 My soul yearns for one last look at you 
 Before I leave you here to be hidden within idyllic peace 
 It’s the perfect memory and I keep it close to me 
 Bound with wire 
 Cut me deep into the seams 
 Flow the colours of the queen 
 I live like I’m the only one, the fragile one that fights to survive 
 Crown the liar 
 Buried deep beneath the cross 
 Tainted hearts forever lost 
 Sweet treasure, let go of all you know 
 Sweet treasure, you are the one, you are my only true pleasure 
 Now watch me burn it all down, parasite town 
 Far down below it’s a fight for survival 
 So scared as I am of you 
 I’ll burn it all down, parasite town 
 I call this survival 
 So scared as I am of you, parasite town.
########### Guiding Lights ###########
I refuse no rivers 
 It’s a revelation that I discovered 
 I’ll follow your many guiding lights 
 And tear away through your love 
 I’ll follow your many guiding lights 
 And now I tell you 
 To follow me under, far below 
 The deeper the secrets, far below 
 I’m pulling you under, far below 
 The deeper the secrets, marry every lie we told 
 Hidden by a shadow cast by the street lights 
 Black walls are closing in fast tonight 
 I’m abandoning all my thoughts and hiding here 
 By the firelight in a mother’s open arms 
 But you know it’s never over when the pain begins to come 
 When everything around you falls apart and comes undone 
 And you fail to take back what you’ve done 
 Now the tears start to fall and panic brings me to my knees 
 You choke me on the floor and grip my neck so I can’t breathe 
 Just take a bow and then you make my body 
 Hollow, hollow, hollow 
 You know my name 
 You know my fate 
 Take my shame, my shame 
 Take my pain 
 Wash away the blame 
 Follow me down 
 Follow me down 
 Follow me down to solid ground 
 There’s a presence around you as the colors start to blur 
 To have a passion for painting letters and comprehending words 
 Be prepared to understand it’s not the world at fault 
 And there will always be somebody to catch you when you fall 
 Show me how to live 
 Teach me how to tolerate 
 Encourage me to give 
 Empower me to love and celebrate 
 I’ll follow your many guiding lights 
 And tear away through your love 
 I’ll follow your many guiding lights 
 And now I tell you 
 To follow me under, far below 
 The deeper the secrets, far below 
 I’m pulling you under, far below 
 The deeper the secrets, binding both the worlds we know 
 Follow

Would you pull me in or push me out? The gold 
 corona’s what I dream about. Pale skin and crystal

 Stay close to me, come lose yourself, walk into

 Come to me, undo yourself, innocently

 Come to me, undo yourself, innocently

 A bind so strong heals my heart. I live a spiritual 
 and supernatural life. Prayers behind every scene. 
 I just can’t be alone. 
 We are taken, we are frozen. 
 You are the winter biting, piercing my skin 
 the storm may come, malevolent fun but I am 
 still here alone. 
 We are taken, we are frozen. 
 I look deep down inside, discovering the truth. 
 I can see the fool that froze the sky with pale skin 
 and crystal eyes.
########### The Constant ###########
Once more, you're a part of this never ending 
 burning fire. Bring some peace to my tired eyes. 
 Take this higher when angels sing with voices of the night. 
 I dream of endless light, a life I sacrificed. I walk 
 through endless night. Then I'm gone again. 
 Once more, we're a part of this constant motion. 
 Give me the strength to keep my body going. Hide in 
 darkness till the day is done. Exposed to so much 
 danger, pacifying strangers. It's a story that I wrote 
 for you, listen closely as I break through. This effigy 
 is spinning free. 
 I dream of endless light, a life I sacrificed. 
 The flood of power will be overwhelming. Run, hide 
 until it's over. Didn't you see I was sinking? I was 
 drowning overboard. I awaken. 
 Sleep with tainted thoughts until the day that you 
 grow old. It's a forgiving notion. I've never been 
 so emotionally blind, I'll never give up and drop, 
 and I know I'll never come back down from here, 
 resisting gravitation. The stars have never been unkind, 
 the galaxies burn into and I know they'll never leave my mind. 
 Life is constant motion, the moon is round 
 but has two sides, the light shines deep into 
 and I see myself in those blue eyes, you 
 are my incarnation. 
 Crying eyes, give me clarity within the darkness. 
 Hide away until the day is done. Reveal to me your 
 nature, secret prying stranger. It's the greatest day 
 you'll ever know. Save me from these crying eyes. 
 Give me strength to keep my body going. Hold my 
 heart and let the blood flow. Exposed to so much 
 danger, pacifying strangers. It's the greatest day you'll 
 ever know. Save me from this drowning state 
 Give in to the flood. This is my last devotion to you. 
 Give in to the endless flood. This is my last devotion to you.

An inwrought irksome rabbit 
 Is washing my stomach 
 I can't stop thinking about my tonsils 
 How they are pendulating between my toes 
 Slowly suffering from liberty 
 I'm naked on a TV set and it's running wild 
 Fast, sweet, and heavy penetrating into my 
 Grandparents' pupils out of reach, but with a 
 Canoe's evil emotion 
 All right, I can admit it now 
 I was a screaming and lying stone operation 
 Who searched his way through car parts 
 Afraid to be recognized by a spoon 
 Birds with empty refrigerators heated up the 
 Children's chair sweat 
 There was no chance to drive the table without 
 A blue sock, 'cause my mistakes rolled down above 
 The forest of investigation 
 As soon as I heard my neighbor bend his arm 
 With a submarine, the milk was hot and dangerous 
 Like a bed 
 Nobody understands how wipe washers can breathe cows 
 Farting magazines are wading in waxed scarecrows 
 Falling flesh punched me in my bath suit look alike neck 
 Which controls universe with an iron grip of umbrellas 
 I'm wiping away some mirrors from the snakes 
 Without drinking any bus stations 
 Sorry, I'm in love with a door
########### Abnegating Cecity ###########
Your words such unessential lies 
 Refract my barred-up eyes 
 You all tell me I'm confined 
 In my "shell of hallucinations" 
 So try and make me realize 
 Break my secure enclosure 
 Just try and I know you'll make me laugh 
 To hell with your damn comprehension 
 You belabor me for past and present mishaps 
 As if I had the might of alteration 
 You've had your trips into my brain; I know you begrudge 
 Now let me leave for my amenity 
 So you see, you white-coated freak 
 I don't need your allegations 
 Instead, join me to sanity's end 
 With my sweet needle of salvation 
 Increasing needs 
 Of my only friend 
 The one I trust 
 He runs in my veins 
 Hides me away 
 Under his soothing crust 
 Madness reigns 
 You're no longer in charge of my alluring illusions 
 That takes me wherever i want, my 
 Malnutriated malice 
 Rises strong and makes me the ruler of 
 Earth, wind and fire 
 As reality fades, I'm a king on clouds 
 The self-pity no longer runs in my veins; I'm a 
 Malevolent revelation; please let me stay 
 Give me more 
 Left out, dragged down into emptiness 
 Drowning in floods of misunderstanding 
 Why do you all look aside? 
 You're ripping my dignity away 
 Inside, identity is leaking out 
 Realization is catching up on me 
 My needs bashes false immortality 
 Into my affected being... Chaos 
 Cravings of delight 
 Slowly eats my soul 
 Trapped within myself 
 Defraying my own lies 
 Bewalling my demise 
 Deep penury... Internally 
 I feel marred by errors, can't you see? 
 My desires are calling for me 
 The sovereign of abnegations 
 Swings his feelers for a new relation 
 Come, mesmerize my oppressive mind 
 Tear apart these vehement cravings 
 Give me something to live for, bring me back 
 From my purgatory of obsessions 
 Increasing needs 
 Of my only friend 
 The one I trust 
 He runs in my veins 
 Hides me away 
 Under his soothing crust

 Why am I bound to this deranged deformity? 
 I'M DYING HERE
########### Qualms Of Reality ###########
Redundant cruelty 
 Children are shoveled into enclosed solitude 
 In lack of value cause by minor defects 
 Each one an unsuitability 
 Outside the publics field of vision 
 Left to die on a bed of concrete 
 While the rich swallows ostentation 
 Distorted minds screaming for consolation 
 The vanity of convenience rules the world 
 LOCKED UP 
 Who cares about rights 
 SO WHAT 
 If the world's a bit rude 
 The PROSPEROUS 
 Pay to keep it concealed 
 Leaving problems untouched because of fear 
 ABONDONED LIVES 
 Hundreds in a room, staring with empty swollen eyes 
 Mutilated possibilities 
 Enslaved by INSANITY 
 The belligerent ARROGANCE of the leaders 
 Strangles the subjecteds RIGHT 
 To a childhood of safety 
 NIGHTMARES But for real for ever engraved 
 In the minds of lost infancies 
 SHUT OUT 
 From this dying world of calumny 
 INFANTICIDE 
 A thousand souls a day flows away with the breeze 
 Living corpses, breathing lungs filled with disease 
 Underdeveloped twisted thoughts, trying to understand 
 Unfairly secluded by the prevailing injustices 
 That pushes this mentally ill world 
 Over the edge of acceptance 
 LOCKED UP 
 Who cares about rights 
 SO WHAT 
 If the world's a bit rude 
 The PROSPEROUS 
 Pay to keep it concealed 
 Leaving problems untouched because of fear 
 DEATH INSIDE, WITHOUT REACH-THEIR FREEDOM. BOUND TO FEEL, WITHIN- 
 ILLNESS FLOATING. SOULS IN PENURY, SOON TO FADE OUT-AGGRAVATION IN 
 CHARGE...BEMOAN OPPRESSION, EXTENSIVE CARNAGE BEHIND WALLS OF 
 UNCERTAINTY, WE'LL REALISE AS THE FLOODS OF INSIGHT COME DOWN
########### We'll Never See The Day ###########
Justice runed by eternal travesty 
 Bloodcurdling hammer soon to be released 
 Stalking brutality tomorrow we will see 
 the unjustified agony unleashed 
 Strangling superstitious braces 
 Rampage overboard 
 Remoted deathmasks have no faces 
 We only see the cord 
 Lead to pathes and alleys 
 chosened by a treacherous source 
 Squeeze the odds down to our last days 
 To summon up their force 
 Folded to pernicious chambers 
 Pounded by the walls Disappear noone remembers 
 Nobody hear our calls 
 Ruthless saints prey upon us 
 The society of friends 
 They are the wounds we are the pus 
 No matter how i ends 
 Maimed and left to putrefy 
 Betrayed by society 
 Indiscreet left to die 
 Filled with indignity 
 We will come to grief 
 By this irrational democracy 
 What's a life worth for humanity 
 Nothing more than justice by insanity 
 Utilization, covetousness 
 A voracious mouth to feed 
 Fatal greed engraves our death 
 Chokes our possibilities 
 We are the children of this devastating science 
 We are the lost till the end 
 We are the victims who knows who is lying 
 Forgotten we are dying 
 WE ARE DYING 
 WE'LL NEVER SEE THE DAY 
 WE'LL NEVER SEE THE DAY 
 WE'LL NEVER SEE THE DAY 
 WE'LL NEVER SEE THE DAY
########### Greed ###########
Vitalize your benevolent thoughts today 
 Encrust the encumbrance that encroach your brain 
 A devastated world we'll see in tomorrow's society 
 crushed by our own alternatives we've got ourselves to blame 
 Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude 
 WE OBLITERATE OURSELVES 
 Procrastinated measures decrease our chance to save 
 'Cause you've always got something else in mind 
 The reignes rain of pollution melts our opportunities 
 Conjectural in their comfortable lives 
 Stupidity's separated by a wall of glass 
 We have to stop this immediately this fucking mess 
 Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude 
 WE OBLITERATE OURSELVES 
 Procrastinated measures decreases our chance to save 
 'Cause you've always got something else in mind why? 
 NOW IT'S TIME TO SAVE US 
 NATURES DEMISE 
 We can't control our accessies spreading 
 Pollution we fumble till the end 
 THE END 
 The water is filled with toxic waste 
 And the air is filled with shit to breathe 
 Soon a dismembered world we'll see 
 WE ARE IN DEEP SHIT 
 We have to change this world 
 START TO COMMUNICATE 
 We can't go on like this no 
 NO 
 ...and all this because of greed 
 Now it's time to perceive our inauspicious oversight 
 We're leaning on death against compensation 
 Are we so afraid to lose our welfaresociety 
 That we have to sacrifice ourselves, the earth 
 Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude 
 WE OBLITERATE OURSELVES 
 Procrastinated measrues decreases our chance to save 
 'Cause you've always got something else in mind why?
########### Choirs Of Devastation ###########
Melting hands, as in fear they've ruled 
 But will not anymore 
 Determination now only a coagulating fluid 
 Burning its pathes down the sad soil 
 Clouds pregnant with heavy rain 
 Opens up its portals and pour upon earth, 
 The moist of a lost childhoods 
 Embrace as it boil. 
 Believe-as you see-the anticipation 
 Lost in mourning choirs of devastation 
 The aimless glow, we thought would never cease 
 Now groan out its renunciation. 
 Toxic airwaves throwing their corrosion, 
 Like patternless meshes over consumed ground. 
 Earth, blindly-stretch out her maimed arms, 
 Only to receive the certainty-there's no help to be found 
 No one's to blame as streams of equality washes away, 
 The last traces of humanity's existence. 
 We just sat, like contented denials as abnegation 
 Took its toll in exterminations' enhance. 
 We claimed, the dead would open the eyes of the living, 
 But who's left to exclaim the words-we were right. 
 Memories of anguish lie as whisper in the heat 
 Only bareness observe the last remains float out of sight.
########### Humiliative ###########
I'm the concrete leper 
 Sickness repulsion embodied 
 But hear the sermon escaping my vermin mouth 
 You might even stay with me in the dirt 
 I'm soaked in putrid sewage risen from empty words 
 To you, a legion of nausea 
 I'm your sins, I'm your crown of thorns 
 I've seen the blood of generations 
 The ravenous mouth called system 
 We're all shaped by vulgar hands 
 The grip of hate and lies 
 The sustenance to our bellicose ways 
 An ignorance almost justified 
 As the gap of humanity fraction grows 
 The skull of life lobotomized 
 Hear me! I'm ignominy! 
 There's no renaissance in bleeding 
 No! 
 I've flown a million minds black in despair 
 The liquids of uncertainty spit into their eyes 
 Our flesh embedded in counters of iniquity 
 It seems like we are all just merchandise, not civilized 
 No words, we adapt in our silence, paralyzed 
 To changes, erasing the last denial lines 
 Attitudes crucified, still we're going on 
 Crawling toward submissive suicide
########### Sickening ###########
No one knows the soul of tears and why can't we see human indignity 
 Who will laugh at the growing suffering, the bleeding rapidly, breeding increasing 
 The clock is ticking on before us, constantly running 
 Hypnotized, energized, by naivety 
 Take a pick at random choose our future to be crawling in the mess of stupidity 
 We won't hear when we're dead and gone 
 We trust in lies or a fake paradise 
 Are we blinded til' the bitter end 
 Decided or maybe very misguided 
 Travelling through endless times inside of nothingness 
 Reaching for a new belief in vain, insane 
 Our molded lives, an ever catatonic flow 
 We're rejected evermore by lucidity 
 Why strain? Why? 
 Why change? Why not suicide 
 No strain! No! 
 No change! No, not suicide! 
 With ears that are shut to the inner voice 
 We're giving in to the shattering 
 Tell me how can we take it 
 Tell me why are we here 
 Hanging in the balance of deceit and blasphemy 
 Paralyzed in sightless drains ignorant and still no panic 
 Is there no way to be free? 
 No? Why me, not us? 
 Why not blind strain? Blind! 
 Blind faith! Blind suicide! 
 Damn Faith! Damn! 
 Damn Lies! Why?

########### Gods Of Rapture ###########
I feel torn apart 
 A vile misfit fallen 
 Deep into affliction 
 Of my hollow mind 
 The sense of suffocation 
 Grows inside my lungs 
 When I wake into truth, 
 I'm back among the blind 
 The truth of lies 
 Disenchanting my eyes 
 How can I survive 
 I can't stand being 
 Alive 
 Gods of rapture 
 Enshrouding my eyes 
 I try to hide 
 Then slowly, I die 
 My past laugh at me 
 From the other side of negation 
 Untying the lasting few 
 Cords of common sense 
 Submerged into the flow 
 The rapids of addiction 
 Too weak to push it back 
 A worm without defense 
 My flesh fading undressing the bones 
 Behold me naked; cadaver exposed 
 This, my abuse 
 I can't take it no more 
 The fragile truth sneering at me 
 With teeth pressed 
 Like thrusting nails into my head 
 All my life, I regret
########### Future Breed Machine ###########
An even strobe a pulse of flashing hate 
 Lights of synthetic souls massproduced 
 Hammered into shape a sign of times dreams 
 Turn into systems a new way a new breed 
 Implanted in our minds 
 Here I am in the hand of a sterile hate 
 The new control I can not wake 
 I'm not a sleep 
 New intelligence arise in emptied bodies 
 Turgid flesh tested through eternal spastic 
 Fits through not known codes mother 
 Machine in genocide now scorn a dying race 
 Evolution in reverse now it's time for me 
 Changing what am I to be contorted 
 An eternity defeated 
 Programmed to appease you we're symbols of perfection 
 Humanoids runed by your laws: 
 Destroy erase improve lesson first: 
 Submission we're docile servant dogs 
 Our leashes are your limbs computed deep within 
 Remoted minds controlled our thoughts 
 No more doubts 
 The new way is here disgorged 
 Another thousands fakes that obey to a circuit skein to vacuum 
 Mechanical thoughts 
 I now conceive no longer me 
 Always to see inanity 
 Millions to be units like me 
 Eternally human patterns 
 Copied, dissected, distorted 
 Completed to fit the machine 
 The nerve fibres give in to cords to the unknown 
 See me be me same contents same machine 
 The currency of ours 
 No more flesh and bone 
 We are too unaware of what we have been before 
 Evolution in reverse 
 Now it's time for me 
 Changing what am I to be contorted 
 An eternity defeated by the new machine
########### Beneath ###########
It's time to go into the me below 
 My morbid self beneath 
 A peril trip the last way out 
 I spin as I let go 
 In spirals down the narrow lines 
 Passing through my aura 
 Spit me out into my mind 
 A journey through disease 
 I'm behind my cynic eyes 
 That stare but can not see 
 The sickness in me ... beneath ... 
 I fall in untruthful me the essence of 
 My thoughts 
 Swirling in a thousand vows endless 
 Truth less 
 What am I this me beneath 
 A vain organic lie 
 That rules me from inside 
 Immobile now I bow before reality itself 
 It's substance moving through my eyes 
 My life is transferred once suffused upon 
 My mind the view erases burns inside 
 And then another fall 
 I plunge into a well of lies a cold 
 Perennial flow the vortex of my soul
########### Soul Burn ###########
Inner perception trapped in a soul cage 
 Human wreckage I leave my liquid face 
 Who am I sense blurred who's my mind 
 In this life obscured 
 Visual progressions leave me no peace 
 Subliminal merger clutch the 
 Fence of needs 
 What's there in desperation what's real 
 Flawless confusion 
 Void of emptiness reign my truth 
 Before my eyes flashes of youth 
 Memory-nuances pass where's my life 
 Frayed pictures mass 
 Insidious deception feelings fade 
 Ravenous mirrors I praise the 
 Blackened day 
 What am I to reality what's in line 
 Subsequently 
 Forever turning through a lifetime 
 Endless burning of soul and mind 
 Step by step I'm taken through the past 
 To burn in fear of lies I'm lost mouldering 
 Oblivions grasp makes my soul burn 
 Burn 
 This astray mind has sieged my soul 
 Forever chained to this tearing cold 
 I'll never tell the truth from lies 
 Disbelief covers my eyes I'm lost mouldering 
 Perpetual pain in this soul burn 
 Pieces to me strange wrapped up disguise 
 Reflections of myself in another life 
 I see it vague before my eyes 
 Pictures drawn of naked bare lies 
 It makes no sense to live this mess 
 Constant until I find my rest 
 Enemy within a soul in flames 
 Gaining it's pulse breeding inside 
 Pressure increase drowns my belief 
 As I unveil myself in me 
 Burn
########### Transfixion ###########
Trapped in a gaze where time stand still 
 Connected to a blur sensations deformed 
 We are to drown just to become 
 Another set of eyes among the millions 
 Enchanted we fade selecting illusions 
 Dwellers of the scene a new world obsessed 
 Gods of displays divine screens 
 Radiate us now your blessing 
 Down kneel to shields of glass 
 To the sovereign 
 Bleed for the entity of wavelenghts 
 Transfixed yet eyes glowing with delight 
 Delusions of omniscience bred us by liars 
 Mentally drained by the growing leech 
 Fed on our manic desire 
 Oceans of sewage continual 
 Washing into our minds 
 Drowning in wasted integrity 
 With eyes too open to see vanity 
 Engulfed in super fiction fields 
 What are we when the false pictures 
 Dissolve 
 Caged within a twilight world 
 Devoid of own self made thoughts 
 Stare blind...
########### Vanished ###########
Convalescent livid we succumb 
 Stagnation now complete 
 This is the new plague called 
 Unconsciousness 
 We're selfcaged in defeat 
 Clotted minds coagulate we are trapped 
 Inside the tears we obey resignate to our 
 Self-inflected fears 
 Voices calm will be never heard 
 In this mode who will change 
 Bantised in our minds so absurd 
 Is this the world sublime 
 Into pools of paranoia we're fading with 
 Reality drained by lies we are al inhuman 
 Introspective vanishing 
 Sterile thoughts now upraised in subhuman 
 Majesty bodies numb still enchained 
 Where am I in hell of our dreams 
 Wrong wrong I'm in the now the vain reality 
 So it seems we're dying yet content 
 Worship our chrysalis stage since when are 
 Lies devine 
 Since when 
 This is now degrade indulge 
 This is us servile obliging 
 Swallowed by our hunger for mendacity 
 As this dance whirls deeper into hate 
 We're vanishing 
 In down deep cold where am I caught cage 
 Trapped not in dreams now time has killed 
 Our eyes fall fade gone dead away
########### Inside What's Within Behind ###########
I can't run away from this thing in me 
 I'm weakening down another now developing 
 Within 
 I can feel it it's inside my head 
 Connected to my brain this other me is 
 Slowly taking over deep beneath the 
 Eye that 
 All can see energic visions of the one 
 I know myself to be 
 Look into my eyes don't listen to their lies 
 How can I stop this from being real 
 No my life will be no longer what it always 
 Used to be 
 Life neglected infected by strain 
 I fall into the smothering the even 
 Flow of 
 Ravaging pain this my temple of selfcaged 
 Contempt a body slowly pierced by 
 Inevitable me 
 Do I differ from yourself am I like 
 They say 
 The truth eventually I'm the one you 
 Wanna be 
 Can you feel the same as I another inside 
 Pushing to free itself from the chains 
 Of the soul 
 Turn your eyes toward the inside 
 Dig deep within I'm sure you'll find 
 A different self a different soul 
 To put you in peace with mind
########### Terminal Illusions ###########
I don't need religion 
 God bless no one 
 Me and my own opinions 
 Are written by me 
 You surrender 
 Under mass hypnosis 
 Bound to illusions 
 Produced by your god 
 Who is humane 
 Real alive no god 
 I see your blindness 
 Erase your identity 
 Your mind is hollow 
 Carved to inability 
 I know to be 
 Loyal to myself 
 My integrity leaves myself 
 Alone in peace with me 
 God 
 There's no god 
 Life is a trap 
 Unlock your mind 
 Trust in yourself 
 Wake from the grip of the tongue 
 You've been choked oppressed 
 God owns god cheats god lies 
 God hates god kills god slays 
 The pressure on humanity 
 Has risen beyond control 
 We are leading evolution 
 Into termination 
 The sense of hate 
 Inbreeding scars to innocence 
 Genetic prejudice a 
 Selfdestructive line in pain 
 Why this reality 
 Life poured into inanity
########### Suffer In Truth ###########
Tortured soul ripping skin into ashes 
 Blind by pain deaf by lies 
 Smell of freedom violently cuts 
 Forgiveness 
 Power to a being never dies 
 Suffer in truth's narrow passage saw 
 Weak solutions stabbed to now know 
 The smile of obliterations face 
 Penetrating through the void of life 
 A dance with the dead 
 Buried in oblivion stolen from the mind 
 Constant starving never fed 
 Contaminated life is fading 
 Laughing in my face 
 Suffer in deception 
 Manipulated not to feel 
 Slain beliefs abandoned dreams 
 A life of misery 
 Suffer in truth 
 The wounds of a soul in pain 
 A mirror of life 
 Dreams all in vain 
 Life will always be sealed 
 I see... unseen 
 I feel... unseen 
 Suffer in truth
########### Sublevels ###########
Back again within myself 
 Asleep but aware I'm lost again 
 Every time I close my eyes 
 I enter the dream to which I'm strained 
 A sudden change into a state 
 Where life is dust 
 And everything flow 
 Circling above swirling seas 
 Of eyes upraised toward the unknown 
 Vapour masques in the leaden air 
 Unleashed by death in a grubby dawn 
 Vacant faces reflecting sorrow 
 Hidden inside senses disowned 
 A maze of glass shattered by thoughts 
 Of a faltered soul freed in bliss 
 Clouds disperse revealing shades 
 Tempting my soul I can't resist 
 A vision of morbidity 
 Of ragged silent shadows 
 Dressed in black disease 
 They're closing up on me 
 Peering lifeless weary eyes 
 They drag me down into 
 Another world inside of me 
 Paralyzed by the view 
 Hypnotized let me wake 
 Mesmerized by the flames as I return 
 Into myself a slow conversion a silent 
 Change I wake into the brightened day

########### Concatenation ###########
A stale organic cage. 
 Incarceration. 
 I'm in the stranger: Me. 
 The user of my face; 
 Beneath it's guise I rot. 
 A paradox in terms. 
 Interconnected, fused. 
 My words are it's thoughts. 
 I now share myself with my reflection. 
 Straining to divide our twined formation. 
 Duality within singularity. 
 Plug me in, re-connect me to myself. 
 Plug me in, re-connect me to my soul. 
 Coalescence done. 
 The merging complete. 
 The sentence carried out. 
 The confluence, 
 Our interwound flows; 
 Surges not to be fused. 
 In this mental cage we absorb ourselves. 
 The only certainty is my suffering. 
 My mind in constant pleas for an end to this concatenation. 
 A struggle all in vain, 
 We're both the same. 
 Plug me in, re-connect me to myself. 
 Plug me in, re-connect me to my soul. 
 Gone is all my hope, 
 All my vain illusions. 
 Deceived, I dwell in me, 
 In the core of my agony. 
 I fade in this duress, 
 I'm weakening. 
 The one who claimed my front is now the claimant of my soul. 
 Into the core of self, The neuro-axis, I fade. 
 Within the fading core of self, I am..... 
 Gone-bound, lost, away, phased out, non-existing.

 So elevated

 I speak no word unheard. 
 Remotivate me.

 An omnipotent being complete in my diversity 
 Ripples race across my eyes. 
 Breaking out in acid sweat. 
 Wills shrivel and crack. 
 Disintegration of my inner self. 
 I find the substance lost. 
 A shed shell of a being of disgust. 
 Done is the cleansing. 
 Complete is the surgery of the soul. 
 Step inside and taste the shackling thoughts that devour all confidence. 
 Realizing I'm lost. 
 Being no more than a mutt with a fake pedigree. 
 Stillborn soul shaped and molded.

 A borrowed talent filled with copied goals. 
 The carcass of hope lies dead beneath the fabric of dreams.

 Submerged, battered and numb. 
 Just a mindscape fit for illusion to make fear into reign and fulfillment of pain. 
 Kneeling in perm

 Reanimate, me cause I was once alive. 
 Defeat smears out my focus. 
 Consciousness subsides 
 Unmotivated. 
 Beheld by scorching eyes. 
 Infinity stares back at me.

 This Is Not A Phase 
 Ebullient With Human Filth, Here I Am. 
 Here I Stay. 
 Flourishing In Our Disgrace. 
 Blessed Be The Human Way
########### The Exquisite Machinery Of Torture ###########
A sustained static gaze, oblivious to surroundings. 
 Empty, strained, unmoving eyes; Introverted, paralyzed 
 A burning mass of emotions denied, enraged by years of silencing. 
 An accumulation of feelings suppressed, returning to devour. 
 Bright rays of chaos, generated by subconsciousness. 
 A retribution by own thoughts; twisting the mind into fits 
 Fuelled with pains unveiled. Burning with contamination. 
 Set afire by disowned self-lies; they penetrate the eyes. 
 I... Am I the next? Self inflicted overload. 
 Thoughts returning to think me away. 
 I... Will I be reprieved, 
 or am I just awaiting the sentence of my exquisite, 
 internal machinery of torture 
 The turmoil arises, from the innermost core of denial. 
 Shining streams of putrefaction, reflugent with disease - 
 In outward motion to redress the balance by retaliation. 
 A terminal journey to relieve cognition of Ability 
 Minds lit like candles, by rejected senses and emotions. 
 Tearing flames, born in mind; Creations of self deception. 
 Strained, not to lose the grip - Humans locked in the new disease. 
 A light by eyes unseen has come to burn us clean. 
 (Chorus:) I... Am I the next?....... 
 I sense; The facilities of the bodily; Discorporated by the light 
 All my pleas; denied 
 By my psychological enemy 
 The inner light unseen 
 I... I'm deceived by my 
 Receiving eyes; - susceptible 
 to the endless killing-sights 
 Consciousness fails the grip. Substance now decreasing 
 Amorphous. Without shape - I'm vanishing; dematerialized 
 My own corrosive thoughts - Probes armed with acid tools 
 Disintegrated, I'm bleached out of reality 
 Scattered bits internally; My last transparent remains; 
 Floating objects inanimate; Spinning into my soul 
 Defeated by my contents. Tables turned, I'm a thought repressed 
 I'm swallowed into myself. Destination; nothingness 
 I... Am I the next? Self inflicted overload 
 Thoughts returning to think me away 
 I... Will I be reprieved 
 Or am I just awaiting the sentence of my exquisite, 
 internal machinery of torture 
 I... I've been the next. My self inflicted overload, 
 My neglected thoughts have thought me undone. 
 I... I was never reprieved 
 Now I know the sentence of me exquisite, 
 internal machinery of torture
########### Elastic ###########
Assembled from dead incompatible pieces; Livid fragments regenerated. 
 Decomposing bits of organic matter, brought to life, revived. 
 A fluid, limbless, sickening shape, a faltering semi-floating cluster. 
 Its sole purpose of creation; To burst the imagination blood surge. 
 Defying the mould of human flesh. Smashing the wall of beliefs. 
 A sight to bring insanity to all dimensional reality. 
 Carved from thoughts unthought into a graphic, visible delusion of life. 
 A twisted display of dehumanized features, by cells reflected, refracted. 
 A frantic dancing of particles, in pathetic attempt at rendering flesh; 
 Swirling to project the illusion of shape, form, dimension and mass. 
 (Eyes not made for watching. Thousand watt obsidian bulbs; 
 Reflective, obversed. The only view is the barren self) 
 A walking translucent entity. Void, suspended. Inviolate by rules, all standards of existence. 
 An electrified vapor-cloud. A skein of bone and tissue. 
 An atrocity, a liquid form unshaped to the organic norm. 
 A mind not filled with thoughts, but a random flickering static. 
 A soulless creature un-alive; I'm the un-human elastic.
########### Stengah ###########
Lacerating pains of degeneration speed through your trembling mind 
 Still, in machine-like strife you gain another mile 
 The temporary elusive goal: 
 To reach the solace, to feed once more upon the synthetic reaper of loss. 
 No matter the outcome, the cost 
 Cold and stinging needs tearing through the halls 
 Of your defiled, flesh made temple with its closing walls 
 Still you claim the worshipers pose and you bow. You kneel 
 Control: once superior, now a docile pet at chaos's feet 
 Pulling the leash as it trails the scent to where all hurt recedes 
 Your past a blurry patch in mind, your future once; now thin dreams filed 
 Toward the lights of need you strive - to drink into your vein the shine 
 Beaten to the unforgiving ground. 
 Lashed into submission by the inner starving demon, by its unrelenting hand 
 Still you claim the worshipers pose and you bow. 
 You kneel to the syringe 
 Answering only to authorities of sedation. 
 Their calls the only ones heeded 
 A worn out soldier touched by their contagion. 
 A battered drone at their feet 
 You're the one betrayed. 
 An outcast set afire by your inner war 
 Your burning self so far astray. 
 A combustion fanned from within your core
########### Rational Gaze ###########
Squint your eyes to see clearly 
 Blur reality to make it real 
 Let focus go from your deceiving eyes 
 To know what's been concealed 
 We've all been blinded 
 Subjects to visual misinformation 
 A systematic denial of the crystalline 
 To see the fine grain, to read the hidden words 
 The context of parallel truth 
 Devoid of fragmentation 
 Our light-induced image of truth 
 Filtered blank of its substance 
 As our eyes won't adhere to intuitive lines 
 Everything examined, separated, one thing at a time 
 The harder we stare 
 The more complete the disintegration 
 Dissolution 
 Eyes re-opened 
 Reasoning focalized 
 Receptors activated 
 Perspectives distorted 
 The ladder beyond our grasp 
 The twin-headed serpent forever hidden 
 Where's the true knowledge 
 Where engines of the sane and insanity merge 
 The clarity 
 The unity 
 Reality untouchable, transparent 
 Invisible to our fixed, restricted fields of vision 
 Existence taken for granted 
 Absolute 
 Possessed, owned, controlled 
 By the common sense-infected rational gaze 
 Onward forever we walk among the ignorant 
 Never stray from the common lines
########### Perpetual Black Second ###########
Trapped in a ceaseless fever of spite, 
 an unending fit of resentment and anger 
 Caught in a moment of unforgiveness 
 In the snapshot of a hate filled second 
 The speechless flickering of uncomprehending eyes 
 -Dilated in disbelief 
 Your vacant gaze distorted 
 Twisted in its accusing glare 
 Teeth glimmering in emotional rage 
 Spit of hate suspended in mid-air 
 Bodies strained in fury 
 Devoured by jaws of despair 
 One single image frame I wish to forget 
 now replayed in succession of millions 
 The one second I will always regret 
 -My hell found in its reiteration 
 Held within the visualization, 
 the continuous rerun of my own violence 
 A fraction of time perpetuated 
 By my regretful soul animated 
 Please forgive the evil in me - The darkness within 
 Ferocious, inherent demon. Adrenaline gland resident 
 Threatened subconscious snake. Repressed into 
 striking coil 
 Surfacing that black second. Ascending with the boil
########### Closed Eye Visuals ###########
Unbound to the pale and lifeless day by the multicolored, multiform 
 A spinning antidream unthought. 
 Exceeding the obsolete reality 
 Overheated inner shape-generator. 
 Blowing every cerebral fuse 
 Insanity filtered and systematized. 
 Feeding the tools of mind abuse 
 Mind-signal transmission peaked, distorted, bent, 
 Unrestrained neuroreceivers shortcircuit. 
 System parameters over-gained 
 Nervethreads decoding the stream of the reality-inverting revolution 
 The patterned untruth of non-dream: The closed eye visual delusion 
 A frantic cellular race down the switchbacks of mind 
 Throttling the existence-engine. 
 A propulsion beyond all limit lines 
 Convulsive thrusts of septic energy as infected cells collide 
 Unleashing the video-bacterial disease - the sinew-conducted pseudo-vision 
 Mind-signal transmission peaked, distorted, bent, 
 Unrestrained neuroreceivers short-circuit. 
 System parameters over-gained 
 Nervethreads decoding the stream of the reality-inverting revolution 
 The patterned untruth of non-dream: The closed eye visual delusion 
 Self unfolds like a disintegrating dream. 
 All revealed but the sinister cause 
 My lying eyes come apart at the seams. 
 Still how could I ever regret the loss 
 The self transformed into wave lengths 
 Reverberating this unyielding dream. 
 Lost in this greedy illusion 
 I'm forever devoured by the closed eye visual delusion 
 A twirling visual overload 
 Explosions of terror and beauty 
 Colors of fear and pain within clash into unanything 
 (A spectra-organic frenzy setting fire to the neuro-highways of mind 
 Revolving me away from time. A soul now rendered unassigned)
########### Glints Collide ###########
Winds that shine a bright, blinding dark. Kerosene flames so cold they crack 
 Suns that blow becalmed twisters. Ferocity sleeping. Nothingness stacked 
 Intestines worn to shield the inward limbs. Screams unheard. Deafening thoughts 
 Levitating ground. The solid water burns. Liquid stone. The immobile turns 
 Corrosion soothing the hurt within 
 Surroundings reaching to touch your skin 
 Progress in stalemate. Death is alive 
 Eyes and mind glint - Glints collide 
 Pains sending shivers of wellbeing down your spine. Sounds of healing crack your bones 
 Lamentation carving into smiling faces. Surrounded by everyone, still you're all alone 
 Wormholes set as halos over sinners' skulls. Leaves chasing the fallen air away 
 A lifetime of needle-eyes too wide to escape, where honesty lies and angels betray 
 Incisions mending the wounds within 
 Surroundings breach the surface of your skin 
 Progress in static. Life has died 
 Eyes and mind glint - Glints collide 
 Reincarnation trapped in a life span. 
 Corpses bolted to the ground arise 
 Omnilights flooding your world with their darkness 
 as your reflection turns its back to your eyes 
 You've entered your self-created antiparadise 
 Your universe processed and tapped in jars 
 Neverending insanity 
 Down in the hell of mind, where glints collide
########### Organic Shadows ###########
The glued-on sheet of self control. The pity of 
 sense, of sanity 
 -Cracking at the seams. Torn from my reality 
 The motion of thoughts subdued. Overcome, suppressed 
 by terror 
 The mouth of fear overfed by dread beyond measure 
 Pounding waves of overload running through my every 
 nerve 
 Will reduced to nothingness. My system overturned 
 My mind resigns to defeat. Internal razors activated 
 -Slashing through unprocessed thought. The severance 
 of self complete 
 Heartbeats hammering at the sight 
 A revelation to wrap my soul in fear 
 Blinded by the neverlight 
 as I stare into my organic shadow 
 The bin of repressed emotions crammed 
 Limits of pain by far exceeded 
 I stare into the blank 
 the mantra of dead silence repeated 
 Hear me. Find me 
 Save me. The dead me 
 (Shallow breathing. Eyes not shut, not open 
 By fear silenced. Incantations never spoken) 
 This hell of vacuum abound 
 with the chanting whispers of the mute 
 Exposed to the wrath of neversound 
 -The words of my organic shadow
########### Straws Pulled At Random ###########
What solace lies in the arms of fate 
 -The ill embrace of uncertainty 
 When did I leave this in other hands 
 -To be pulled down at chance 
 Ripped away by destiny-claws 
 Am I another of fate's possessions 
 Dwelling the lie of freedom 
 Just another straw pulled at random 
 Reclaimed by deceiving time 
 A silent judgment I can not overrule 
 Drawn back into the origin-vortex 
 Uprooted and ground to dust 
 Retracted into anti-existence 
 A magnet repelled by life's polarity 
 Denied the self control of fate 
 we flow suspended in semi-life 
 Until the ever imminent day 
 when oblivion claims our breath 
 Nowhere indefinitely. Not dead, not alive 
 Existence-patterns ripped of symmetry. As will and 
 fate divide 
 Have I appeased the gods of fate 
 Am I allowed another day 
 Must I die to escape 
 the scanning eyes of death
########### Spasm ###########
Stroboscopic contortion-assault. Light bulb language 
 translated into fits 
 Codes of tendon-flickers I can't grasp. Focus lost as 
 I writhe and twitch 
 Random beats of blinding shockwaves. Erratic suns 
 that twist my eyes 
 Flashes pounding at my thoughts as the intrinsic pains 
 multiply 
 Muscle and tissue twined with every violent lash 
 Battered by an unrelenting shine 
 Immobilized by the increasing pains, 
 the procreating agonies of system breakdown 
 Lightwave frequency body-oscillation. Undeciphered 
 motions pass through my flesh 
 Bodily reverberation induced. A corporeal system lost 
 in its waves 
 Bleached into their existence by tremulous epileptic 
 strokes 
 Blasts of irregular pulsar-radiation - Triggering the 
 process of mind and body control 
 Lost to their control 
 A sentence - in flashes told 
 Enticed by their calls; - Insane, divine 
 Torn, undone, dissolved 
 By incandescent gods condemned 
 Burned. Their mark on my soul 
 To my inverted shadow confined 
 Twisted, spun. Vertebras and spinal column unaligned 
 Joints shattered and torn apart. Spasm-rendered 
 distortion 
 Organic spiral. Stretched and torn into a new 
 creation 
 A worldless thing, a thingless word. Lightborn 
 malformation
########### Nebulous ###########
Drowned in this screaming silence 
 Embraced by shadows, they tear me 
 The wormholes free my eyes 
 The blood boils - it knows 
 My thoughts burn as minds liquefy, vaporize 
 Reality scorched by this fixed state 
 All beginnings slain by ends 
 I seep down into the black to breathe 
 Drifting to merge with the past 
 My tongue licks the residue of the future 
 Bitter taste, the wombs of claws call me 
 Filth rips them open. The stillborn start to move 
 Lidless eyes twitching beneath a sheet of rot 
 They reach out, they want to kiss - It matters not 
 In dreams it speaks to me of the truth that means 
 reality
########### I ###########
I 
 I - this fractal illusion burning away all structure toward the obscene 
 I - to cleanse, to purge, to breach eternity and smother all life 
 Blind - these mortal men of clay, divine and dying in their harnessed form 
 I - this furnace of limitless hate. Bestial, pure 
 The pendulum swings semi-attached to the centre of all 
 I drug these minds into ruin and contempt - the acid smoke of burning souls 
 This is an anomaly. Disabled. What is true? 
 Not destined for incarceration. I crave my nothingness 
 This illness that they whisper of, is that what makes me fail? 
 I see through the eyes of the blind 
 Not clear what it is to be this self I dread, the immense, the rabid I am 
 The cogs turn, grinding away at ceaselessness - willing it to dust 
 Re-desintegration. Convulse. A dead universe - Impales this twilight 
 Fear aligns. Sadistic me. Meant to devour. Despair 
 Sickened by the fact that immortality is not mine to have 
 A snail along a straight razor - dividing itself through motion 
 I charge this feeble product of god 
 Laughing, drenched in the bile of millions 
 Chewing on the stinking flesh of the crown of creation 
 Solitude in splendor has been rivalled 
 Shrouds stained with tarblack vomit 
 Veiling the rotting eyes of the masses 
 The strain of armageddon evolves 
 Shifting through worlds from chaos, to chaos, to chaos 
 I devour this manure of existence - infertile, barren, whole 
 Rancid redeemer. Virulent deterioration of faith 
 Sacrilege in persona. In truth, fundamentally twisted 
 A witness to this savage carnage, a frenzy of animosity 
 The will to mutilate. Dominant deviation 
 The worship of the sick and degenerate will spread 
 I - the nihilist, not the lunatic 
 Ridding my godlike being of doubt 
 Obliterating all hope of escape 
 I - enter the echoes of despair 
 Miracles inverted by default, a reflex to devastate 
 Soaking in the will to violate, to castrate 
 Soiling the purpose of mankind. Deus ex machina on hold 
 The orgasmic, the splendid, the beginning of the end 
 Conception derived from misconceptions 
 The dimensionless features of truth 
 Silence in the core of undoing 
 Untie its knots and set it loose 
 The inertia of my existence is clear 
 Premutations of slaughtered worlds 
 I alone will behold the dying sky 
 A servant of eternity 
 Progress finally, emergence of doom complete 
 Here only to reverse the flow of life 
 I
########### Autonomy Lost ###########
Reaching for the inner bright, the very essence-sun of my dreaming bliss 
 Guided by a fear blinded outside all shades of the perfect black
########### Imprint Of The Un-Saved ###########
The scattered jigsaw of my redemption laid out before my eyes 
 Each piece as amorphous as the other – Each piece in its lack of shape a lie
########### Disenchantment ###########
Me - the paragon of fear, an immobile skein of tangled nerves exposed 
 Hastily clawing my way into the darkest of my inner scenes of torture 
 I stay my breath to escape this slavery 
 I stay my breath to re-awake and face it encore 
 The struggle to free myself of restraints, becomes my very shackles
########### The Paradoxical Spiral ###########
Non-physical smothering. Asphyxiation by oxygen hands 
 Drowning in the endless sky. An ever-downward dive, only to surface 
 The sewage of indecision, on which all sense of self is afloat 
 The vortex-acceleration a constant. Resolute in purpose its choking flow
########### Re-Inanimate ###########
My ignorance cast in the mold of all things absolute 
 I sustain forever my gaze. A stare fixed on the distant oblivion 
 Resting in the inverted state of being dead, non-sensory matter 
 As all the earth, the wind, the fire, the sea behold and learn to pity me
########### Entrapment ###########
Mutiny of self. Insurrection games convincingly performed 
 Incapacitated by physical thoughts acting out the will of tendon and bone 
 Have the bridges of insanity been crossed and forever retracted? 
 Am I standing among a thousand selves? Is the multitude of laughters mine alone?
########### Mind's Mirror ###########
The feeding frenzy of my starving soul 
 Gnawing voraciously at the bones 
 The exo-skeletal patchwork protecting my own reflection within 
 The twin and same engaged in the mirrored act 
 Of chewing away at the shell of my attacking self 
 The paradox unseen 
 Treacherous 
 This deceit to make no choice matter 
 To have and yet lose yourself 
 Until finally all reasons why are forgotten 
 To live through ones own shadow 
 Mute and blinded 
 Is to really see 
 Eclipse the golden mirror 
 And the reflection is set free
########### In Death - Is Life ###########
So imminently visible – this cloaked innocent guilt 
 Sentenced to a lifetime, a second of structured chaos 
 Trampled by the ferocious, raging crowds of solitude 
 I'm the soil beneath me soaking up the sustenance of my own death 
 Extradited to the gods of chance, the deities of all things random 
 Alive, multicolored, twitching in their dead monochrome world
########### In Death - Is Death ###########
Iridescent to the searching eyes, I'm all things vivid in a world of grey 
 So easily spotted, so easily claimed in this domain where all is prey 
 My thoughts a radiant beacon to the omnidirectional hunter-god radar 
 I'm a markerlight of flesh to these subconscious carnivores 
 I am them. I am teeth. I'm their arousal at the kill 
 Feasting on self. A schizoreality warp. The contradiction fulfilled 
 Focus the only means to see me back to life's unending swirl 
 A reversal of passing away, as the world of dead, as away is now my origin
########### Shed ###########
I float through physical thoughts 
 I stare down the abyss of organic dreams 
 All bets off, I plunge 
 Only to find that self is shed
########### Personae Non Gratae ###########
A lie to maintain equilibrium, to hold me in this dead realm - this last ever dream 
 I'm the thought that never crossed my mind - disguised in the evident. Forever unredeemed
########### Dehumanization ###########
A new level reached, where the absence of air lets me breathe 
 I'm inverted electrical impulses. A malfunctioning death-code incomplete 
 All things before me, at first unliving glimpse undeciphered 
 Its semantics rid of logic. Nothing is all. All is contradiction 
 Grinding, churning - the sweetest ever noises 
 Decode me into their non-communication 
 A soundtrack to my failure, one syllable, one vowel 
 A stagnant flow of endings. Un-time unbound. Merging to form the multi-none 
 A sickly dance of matter, malignantly benign. Greeting the chasm - unbearable, sublime
########### Sum ###########
Vision will blind. Severance ties. Median am I. True are all lies
########### Combustion ###########
No more ifs, no bias, no ambiguity 
 No wondering whether this is it 
 Clarity so brightly shining 
 The image so painfully absolute 
 No edges blurred on this awareness 
 No unknown weight to tip the knowledge scales 
 Eyes dilated to grasp it all 
 As every illusion of what we are fails 
 An unquestionable picture - determined, complete 
 Its crystalline lines untouched by doubt 
 So vivid, so deprived of hesitation 
 Shining in its evil splendor 
 The burning hatred of man 
 A million degrees on display 
 Human voracity delineated 
 The demons in us all by fumes portrayed 
 Stare, see, take in, grasp 
 Comprehend, assimilate, behold your reflection 
 The framing - gold plated lies 
 The canvas - hurting souls caught and weaved 
 The artist - the human dream 
 Incinerated, devoured, deceived
########### Electric Red ###########
Humanity peeled from our bones 
 Deprived of integuments that make us real 
 Shadows of flesh to maintain the system 
 Our own blood splashes as we kneel 
 So meticulously machined 
 Into these obedient devices 
 - Puppets, finetuned submissive drones 
 Replicas of each other, clones 
 We're dormant accumulations of flesh 
 In a crimson filtered twilight 
 Mute witnesses to the game 
 Wrenches to keep the bolts of lies tight 
 We're the fabric concealing the stains, 
 The red tainted existence 
 The gullibles to bless your sins away 
 Rags to wipe your blooded trails 
 We give in to the atrophy, 
 To the twining of self-thought knowledge 
 The purpose of the human mind reviled 
 Everlasting ignorance realized 
 The scarlet flood inundates our powerless thoughts 
 Defenseless minds with lies overfed 
 Every thought stained, defiled 
 - Painted the color, the shade of electric red
########### Bleed ###########
Beams of fire sweep through my head 
 Thrusts of pain increasingly engaged 
 Sensory receptors succumb 
 I am no one now, only agony 
 My crimson liquid so frantically spilled 
 The ruby fluid of life unleashed 
 Ripples ascend to the surface of my eyes 
 Their red pens drawing at random, at will 
 A myriad pains begotten in their wake 
 The bastard spawn of a mutinous self 
 The regurgitation of my micro nemesis 
 Salivating red at the prospect of my ruin, my doom 
 Malfunction - the means for its ascent 
 Bloodletting - the stringent voice to beckon my soul 
 So futile, any resisting tension 
 As death-induced mechanics propel its growth 
 The implement, the device of my extinction 
 The terminating clockwork of my gleeful bane 
 The definitive scourge of its mockery 
 The end-art instruments lethality attained 
 Heed - it commands, heed my will 
 Bleed - it says, bleed you will 
 Falling into the clarity of undoing 
 Scornful gods haggle for my soul 
 Mind's eye flickers and vascillates as I let go 
 Taunting whispers accompany my deletion 
 A sneering grin, the voice of my reaper 
 Chanting softly the song of depletion
########### Lethargica ###########
The void clenches its determined jaws 
 A lethargic, careless motion to kill 
 Monstrous, prodigous, indifferent 
 Slow and deliberate its torturous skills 
 Its molars grind and shatter 
 Onerous, leaden bringers of hurt 
 Unhurried in its deadly intent 
 The undoer of all, dense and inert 
 Its design perfected through aeons 
 Pure, immaculate, clean, omnicidal god/machine 
 Calm, precise ambition 
 Untroubled by the roar of unending screams 
 The droning blare of absolute doom 
 The downpitched moan of collapsing dreams 
 Composed, cold, unconditional 
 Uncompromising 'til all is death 
 Extinction, ruin, its malicious cause 
 'Til the last exhalation of human breath
########### ObZen ###########
A state of perfection, immersed in filth 
 Equilibrium obtained 
 Pure in devotion to all things unwell 
 This sweet Zen of our ill condition sustained 
 A new belief-system 
 Salvation found in vomit and blood 
 Where depravation, lies 
 Corruption, war and pain is God 
 Balance 
 Harmony found in the sickly, the vile 
 Unflinching eyes, joyous and gleaming 
 Intense in their need to watch things die 
 A new belief-system 
 Salvation found in vomit and blood 
 Where depravation, lies 
 Corruption, war and pain is God 
 Decay, disgrace, disgust 
 Our state of Zen 
 The grime of contempt and degeneration 
 Sticky, foul and pungent 
 The sediment of our creation 
 We flourish in this bloodred soil
########### This Spiteful Snake ###########
Reality, this spiteful snake 
 Rearing its ugly head 
 Venom dripping from its grin 
 As it tosses yet another obstacle in our way 
 If given a thousand years to collect 
 To process, to portray 
 We could never encompass the voracity 
 Of one single day 
 Trapping us in its winding 
 Its closing malignant cycles 
 A tightening coil to bind us 
 Hold us tight in unforgiving embrace 
 Its all-engulfing jaws, infinite, boundless 
 Biting down on the dying flesh of hope 
 Its fiery breath leveling, dismantling 
 Flattening, tearing down the structures of our dreams 
 Overcome, defeated 
 Terrified, shivering, mute 
 Reality is terror, this truth is absolute 
 Reality, this spiteful snake 
 Shedding its smothering veil 
 A shroud to asphyxiate 
 Exterminate, eradicate
########### Pineal Gland Optics ###########
How come I shiver, hurt and bleed, 
 If in dreams I cannot truly feel 
 Who would dare say, who would claim 
 This hallucination isn't real 
 Synaptical glitch looking glass 
 So enticing, real and free of lies 
 Prodigious, omnifarious 
 It nourishes, it feeds my starving eyes 
 Artificial the catalyst, organic its progeny 
 Voracious spectral offspring - so sweet in its hunger 
 Unbound this new vision, optical regenesis 
 Threatening, so complete in beautiful deformity 
 These authoritive visions order my collective senses, 
 My questioning, doubtful, rigid self to kneel 
 A Judas syndrome in effect - former self the deceiver 
 Its denial the wretched kiss that kept this in disguise 
 Cast off - the conceiling veil, the rational cloak of doubt 
 Torn off - the restraints, the blinded's shackles 
 Burned away - the agony, the fear, true grief 
 A new set of eyes cleansed by a new belief
########### Pravus ###########
Drooling floods of lead 
 Armed with distorted belief 
 Sharp munition spat from our minds 
 Malignancy-rounds, automatic fire 
 Black, acidic bile 
 Seeping wounds of shattered souls 
 Still not pissing out fast enough 
 To quench our thirst for it to bleed us dry 
 Vile, ever-menacing intent 
 Repulsive belligerence shot from toxic minds 
 Blatant disregard for all but self 
 Proudly flaunting the depravity of a race condemned, malign 
 Iterate, repeat these my words 
 Recite the mantra of late: 
 I will corrupt and impair 
 vitiate, dispirit, debase, violate 
 Souls born with hateful intent 
 The deceitful spawn, descendants of lies 
 By the poisoned nails of history stung 
 If granted the will to injure 
 If granted the will to harm 
 - the blades of hurt inexhaustibly swung
########### Dancers To A Discordant System ###########
Listen to the hidden tune 
 The essence of lies in notes defined 
 As we dance to the dissonant sway 
 The choreography refined 
 Will subdued and shackled 
 Reason washed aside 
 Pledging our love to the chains 
 Our ignorance ever-amplified 
 Bloodened hands lead the waltz 
 We're trapped in the out of tune swirl 
 Still we set the show on continue mode 
 And dance to a discordant system 
 We accept the nails we're fed 
 Lies sharpened to bleed us silent 
 Muted from the pains 
 Defiance employed in vain 
 Any attempts to leave the dance, 
 Invisibly suppressed 
 Questions unasked, we learn the steps 
 Eyes shut like all the rest 
 Unsuspecting, willing, blind, controllable herd 
 Pawns in a covert game conducted by hands we trust 
 Dominated, compliant and deceptable 
 Confident that we matter - we don't see that we're but dust 
 Committed to a lie we cannot see, cannot know nor comprehend 
 We're all asinine drones kept in the dark, kept in line 
 Confined, bereft of reason 
 Withering in toxicity 
 The deadly fumes of deceit 
 And we all reek of complicity 
 Humbled, brought to our knees 
 By the weight of our own guilt 
 Our nescient ways the catalyst 
 To injustice and inhumanity 
 We dance - to appease 
 Compete in stupidity 
 Obscured faces file our points 
 Numbers fed to the machine 
 Still we stand in line for the next show 
 The human spine liquefied 
 What are we, but stupefied 
 Dancers to a discordant system 
 We believe - so we're misled 
 We assume - so we're played 
 We confide - so we're deceived 
 We trust - so we're betrayed
########### I Am Colossus ###########
I'm the great Leviathan. Insatiable colossus 
 Titanic engulfer of lives. I reward you, absorb you 
 I'm the monstrous mouth that hungers for your awe 
 Immense construction of lies. I own you, disown you 
 I am life. I'm death. You empower me 
 I'm a mammoth king evoked, conjured by your dreams 
 Summoned by your fears. You need me, you feed me 
 I'm the imposing giant. Infallible dictator 
 My rules apply to all. You'll heed me, bleed for me 
 I am life. I'm death. I decide your fate 
 You empower me. You'd even kill for me 
 Guzzling down your dreams - the tears of unheard pleas I drink, 
 Imbibe with such delight the fear that floods your temporal shell 
 Raging red rivers and streams - the kingdom of my shadow 
 Where dread of man in endless night revives my every cell 
 To those who doubt - your wounds will never heal 
 To those who question my creation - I'm not real 
 I am pain. I am grief. I'm the things you fear 
 I'm the lie whispered into your ear 
 I'm the great Leviathan. I'm dominance and greed 
 You imagined me, so I was conceived 
 I am life. I'm death. You belong to me 
 Call me what I am. I am colossus.
########### The Demon's Name Is Surveillance ###########
Mechanical compound eye 
 Imposed observance. Sentries in the sky 
 Vigilant lenses. Objectives belied 
 In blackened heavens covertly they hide 
 They see you. They see all. They know all indiscretions 
 Compiler of your dreams, your indignations 
 Following your every single move 
 They see you 
 All-seeing instrument. Supreme perception 
 Omnifocal accumulator 
 Thief of integrity. Its gaze upon the blind 
 Information divinity by man designed 
 The lives of all they occupy. Their eyes in dismal gloom 
 The all-piercing, dead oculi - mirrors of our doom 
 Oblivious to the trespass as you gaze into the black 
 The demon of surveillance insultingly staring back 
 - Into you 
 They own your every secret, your life is in their files 
 The grains of your every waking second sifted through and scrutinized 
 They know your every right. They know your every wrong 
 Each put in their due compartment - sins where sins belong 
 They know you. They see all. They know all indiscretions 
 Compiler of your dreams, your indignations 
 Following your every single move 
 They know you.
########### Do Not Look Down ###########
Strive, strive. Surmount the obstacles 
 Become the essence of your goals. Hereditary dream 
 Pray that you may attain that destiny. Fall into the coveted line 
 Where life is but a theme of pretense in lustrous guise 
 Claims and values. Charts of means and status 
 Plaques to show your strife. Do your neighbour clones approve 
 Picture perfect illustration - imitation of life 
 Where the path is evened out. All obstructions removed 
 Great viable citizen 
 Are you happy now? Then praise your God and bow 
 Shimmering surface. The gleam of blinding lies 
 Become the product, the thing you so desire 
 To what length would you go to reach your goals 
 What mantra will you use to justify your means 
 Who will you betray to secure your dream 
 What sins will you commit to avoid your sins be seen 
 Do not look down. Do not look down 
 Or the abysmal beast of nonconformity 
 Might stare some unpleasant truth 
 Into your desensitized mind 
 Shimmering surface. The gleam of blinding lies 
 Become the product, the thing you so desire
########### Behind The Sun ###########
Carelessly you sentence. How indifferently you kill 
 The prophecies of mans corruption fulfilled 
 Arbitrarily you harm. Snap your fingers, cue demise 
 Murder on impulse. Your evil inclinations wrapped in lies 
 Divine man. Appointed. Claiming the stern voice of God 
 Absolute judgments passed from where you cowards hide 
 - The lair of snakes. Your dark haven 
 Where you and your ophidian partisans abide 
 The doctrine of your unholy trinity 
 - The violence, the spite and the enslavement 
 You awesome monarch, you man of dominance 
 All shall be as you decide 
 Illustrious ruler of all things 
 Wield your razors, cut the flesh of man 
 Control, govern and lead us 
 Into the nightmare of your wishes fulfilled 
 Grab the reins, you awesome puppeteer, you conductor of chains 
 Redeemer. Unbreakable strings. Damnation leashes 
 Remote cords extend, the trusses they run 
 They stretch all the way behind the sun 
 So vain our attempts, the useless tugging 
 This meaningless gnawing at restraints by which we're bound 
 Hail the tyrant saint, the great bereaver 
 You will bow before the emperor crowned
########### The Hurt That Finds You First ###########
End this debate. No need to dream of solace 
 I'll be your truth in this game that is life 
 Your will withering away 
 Among the comatose but insight's not your fate 
 Minds align to fire the sequence 
 You will feel the knife as it turns 
 Taste visions of ruin and thirst 
 Make for save haven but I will find you first 
 Capitulate, you know this fight is over 
 Spiritual flesh, my stomach starts to churn 
 A perfected mindjack. Confirmed illusion 
 Euphoric state. You gag, you choke 
 Words, virus. They echo in your ears 
 True bliss through bondage and oh here come the tears 
 I find my joy in fear 
 A soul cadaver I'm the hurt that finds you first 
 Capitulate 
 Hide. You'll be mine either way 
 Grind my teachings on the soulless 
 In a sense, devastations structure bleeding through my sermon 
 The repose of true angels paves my way to power 
 Parasite a state of which you'll be proud 
 Under my soothing shroud 
 Innocence? 
 This systems roaring howl 
 Deafens all reason 
 Questions reduced to silence
########### Marrow ###########
Lasciviously they move 
 Two powers bound for unity 
 Like magnets they align, under immunity 
 The product of their congress, their libidinous deed 
 - Insatiable mouth of conflict and greed 
 Beware the soon to be born bringer of pain 
 One evil by another inseminated 
 Pure hatred conceived 
 The pairing of blood and power 
 A spawn of harm produced 
 Death and profit begotten, fused 
 A ghost-producing offspring. Immorality's embodiment 
 Spite and disgust incarnate. A progeny insane 
 Tar-black ejaculate 
 The seminal bile of conspiracy 
 - The blood of those who died 
 Their innocence, their marrow 
 The pursuit of ruin. Murderous ambition 
 Bloodshed, the careless taking of lives 
 A conduct symbolic of its condition 
 Behold the newborn monstrosity 
 Descendant of avarice 
 Indifferent war machine in all its violent glory 
 A callous iron God born to reign 
 Tar-black ejaculate 
 The seminal bile of conspiracy 
 - The blood of those who died 
 Their innocence, their marrow
########### Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion ###########
Tremors, reverberating frequency of doom 
 How strongly the violent thoughts of vengeance echo 
 Setting in motion the strings of hate. Shudder, shudder, vibrate 
 This is the soundtrack to our hostility, to our malicious intent, 
 To the pointless grudge forever held 
 The callow dream, the dismal wish to harm 
 Animate now the twisted sounds of our disdain, our rage 
 The notations to our contempt, to unforgiveness and loathing 
 A sonic declaration of spite and resentment 
 Its resonance grinding to dust our souls 
 The twine of revenge tightly strung 
 Its subharmonics the undoing of all 
 So enticing the retaliation-chords of man 
 The all-deafening oscillation of the damned 
 Let forth the hateful, the murderous 
 Let their malignant prayers resound 
 The reverbant, odious request. The wish of death abound 
 So enticing the retalitation-chords of man 
 The all-deafening oscillation of the damned
########### Swarm ###########
Insectine man, carnivore. The shape of us, the conduct of flies 
 All-consuming swarm in inconspicuous disguise 
 Bloodseeking, parasitic. Ecstatically tracing decay 
 Thriving in the glow that death emits, the warm perfume it radiates 
 Revolting conformity. Hive mind unity 
 Excitedly their mandibles grind, aroused by vile ambition 
 At the sickly sweet promise of decomposition 
 Deliriously ingesting. Liquefied ruin absorbed 
 Innocence devoured by the elated horde 
 They are us, let's not even pretend 
 Aroused and frenzied they scurry, encircling death 
 A vile swarm awaiting the final breath 
 Myriad eyes visualizing the end 
 Blackened skies. Rabid heavens descend 
 On the bereft, unforgivingly 
 Precious life debased. Our dipteran legacy embraced 
 Crack the shell. Ascend the sky 
 Rise, extend your palpitating wings 
 Crack the shell. Ascend the sky 
 Fly you disgraceful wretched things
########### Demiurge ###########
Writhing and embraced 
 Retribution. Soul eclipse turns solid 
 Energized. Sucking vomit acting like it's honey 
 Deprived of I 
 Falling while thrusting squares through circles 
 Serving one single new dimension 
 Terror rising. Agnostics nemesis. A prophet of extinction 
 I scorch the skies before your very eyes 
 My deliverance - enslavement labelled: love 
 Just trust this nemesis to sign and seal extinction
########### Clockworks ###########
Dismantling the clockwork that makes me the cynic 
 Pallet, wheel and click 
 The properties of mg indifference 
 Reverse-engineering what makes it tick 
 Dissecting the finetuned mechanism 
 Rack and barrel, spring and pin 
 Its synchronous characteristics 
 To kill what makes it spin 
 Disassemble this machinery 
 Re-program these eyes, undo this design 
 Labelled and filed, each part indexed 
 Broken to pieces then thoroughly burned 
 Deconstruction of what I am 
 Buried to make sure he never returns 
 Taken apart, defused, blueprints turned to ashes 
 Eradicate the last remains, remnants of the insane 
 Disintegration, the destruction of me now imperative 
 To purge myself of this condition, complete this dissolution a necessity 
 Break this deceitful machine 
 A lie, what once I was, obsolete instrument 
 An outmoded contraption, a malfunctioning device 
 That callous self now extinguished, that malignant self now disused 
 That conceited invention to nothing now reduced 
 Complete disintegration, the destruction of me now imperative 
 To purge myself of this condition, complete this dissolution a necessity 
 Break this deceitful machine
########### Born In Dissonance ###########
We are origin, we are increate 
 You will see our coming for a thousand years 
 Every violent element incarnate made flesh and fused to one 
 You may call us remnant, as we are all that will be left 
 Brought forth by ancient whisper 
 Deployed by inverse suns 
 To capture the essence of creation and render it undone 
 We come to make all things collide 
 Those joules define what we are 
 An energy born in dissonance 
 Long before first ever star 
 Baptized in the river you call time 
 We know that we are sacred 
 In human tongue we're apocalypse 
 For we bring with us obliteration 
 Through spectacles tuned to infinity, 
 You will see our coming for a thousand years 
 You will know us then for what we truly are 
 The realization of every fear
########### MonstroCity ###########
Skyline draped in shimmering red 
 Irradiant and treacherous 
 Neon prophecies hail the end, the capital of piety 
 Totalitarianopolis, city of dread 
 The glorious streets of dystopia continuously running red 
 This is where self is relinquished 
 Autonomy sacrificed 
 The idolatry of tyrants compulsory 
 Welcome all to MonstroCity where norm is that of the insane 
 All is illusion in MonstroCity 
 Bow to it, it knows your name 
 Relishing the idea of damnation 
 "The wailing and gnashing of teeth" 
 They know for sure where judgment's due 
 "What's above and what's beneath" 
 This is where we fail, where the self-righteous reign 
 The empire of imaginary ghosts 
 This is blind credulity's domain 
 MonstroCity 
 In here everyone knows "the truth" 
 Which unforgiving icon is real 
 Intolerance and prejudice saturates their zeal 
 This is where self is relinquished 
 Autonomy sacrificed 
 The idolatry of tyrants compulsory
########### By The Ton ###########
To you a beast you think you comprehend 
 Not necessarily made all evil 
 In the reflective pool of your eyes 
 I see fear and intrigue co-mingle 
 You hesitate to deem me all bad 
 Yet when my face is shown, your eyes avert 
 New thoughts sprout from that fearfilled soil 
 Your nerves and intuition back on full alert 
 You think that you've seen the truth, you think you know 
 Yet disbelief grinds, the doubt it claws 
 In you sleepless delirium I devour your thoughts 
 If you only knew how your way of life sustains me 
 Like electricity coursing through my soul 
 Your will to retaliate, your vengeful thoughts announced 
 I bring you me - conflict and death 
 And the promise of spilling red by the ton 
 I just might be there in your final moment 
 I just might be the last thing your eyes take in
########### Violent Sleep Of Reason ###########
A systematically applied veil to heedless eyes 
 Focus deflected, ignore 
 This is not our war 
 Bury the abject shame in the same bile as our ideals 
 The potent lubricant to deceits grinding wheels 
 The menacing implications, the violent sleep of reason 
 Betrayal we all help sustain 
 Humanitarian treason 
 This deadly inclination, this forfeiture of innocence 
 The sacrifice of guiltless souls for our own deliverance 
 The pain you feel 
 Indifference thrust into your back 
 Forged from our ignorance from our immorality 
 A parody, this mockery 
 To no avail you kneel before this our insanity 
 Another life condemned 
 Your fate sealed the second you came to exist 
 Your suffering non-essential for we care not if you subsist 
 We will all belie ang allusion, any crime 
 Cower and hide any culpability denied 
 All will imply it's an illusion, a fallacy 
 So when you die, remember we said it's not reality
########### Ivory Tower ###########
Why mourn this travesty 
 Hide this slow degradation 
 Claw and compete mindlessly 
 All things undone too late 
 Craving our waking sleep 
 Is binding us to this ivory tower 
 Serves to complete the truth that we cling onto 
 So what are these things you hold true 
 The defensive wounds of the unknowing eye 
 Weeping thousands of wretched tears 
 To lubricate the end with our fear 
 The concussion from the crack of the whip 
 Nullifies, sensations die 
 Always numbing, always preaching 
 Never resting, never sleeping 
 The construction is our penance here 
 Tumorous growth chiseled in white 
 When the darkness comes to slay the day 
 Enters horrors that you'll be wishing away 
 Which is the way?
########### Stifled ###########
Impotent king beneath our feet 
 You can rule down where you belong 
 In dirt compacted, buried deep, you dwell with those you wronged 
 Down there you can whisper, yell, even blare your odious lies 
 To your silent audience of worms as they share with you, your eyes 
 Tyrant, oppressor 
 Your once resounding voice now just muted cries 
 You self-avowed murderous god 
 Ranks of annelids now you delegate 
 Your commands unheard under ground 
 Where your voice will never resonate 
 Your time has come 
 Declare the majesty fallen 
 Your dominance, your hateful influence forever stifled 
 Your sleep no longer impermanent 
 Decaying matter now sums you up 
 Like all the lives you've taken 
 Now so are you retreating to dust
########### Nostrum ###########
Jealous vengeful fabrication 
 Halo-crowned invention 
 Sacred universal lie 
 Artificial, divine 
 Great archaic obseletum 
 A prevarication, deceitfully contrived 
 Synthesized, fictitious 
 Dreamed up by remote prototypes 
 Opiate for the yearning mass 
 Administered, applied 
 Three letter word for monster 
 Empty promises of healing 
 Profit aptly buried in the lies 
 An industry rapt with avarice 
 Medicatiing blind it's acolytes 
 Useless panacea 
 Imaginary cure-all 
 To you we cry and supplicate 
 Into your hell we fall 
 Blind belief in their eyes 
 Forever atoning 
 Credulousy waiting 
 Gazing to the skies
########### Our Rage Won't Die ###########
Cry if you need to, disguise, evade, hide 
 Run 'til you hit water, then swim 
 Murder in your wake, plan, commit, exact 
 You have earned our rage, now fly 
 Beg if you have to, trade away your pride 
 Run 'til you hit ground, then dig 
 Death in your wake, those fantasies enacted 
 You will learn that our rage won't die 
 You will surely pay the ultimate price 
 There is no way you will escape our retribution 
 It will not matter how long it takes 
 You took them from us so we will take you 
 Do you believe that luck will somehow stand you by? 
 Do you really think our resolve will wane? 
 Do you really think that it will dissipate? 
 We will haunt you, we will come for you 
 To collect on what you owe to us 
 Eye for eye, life for life 
 Only payment in full can end this strife
########### Into Decay ###########
The most eloquent confession, your silence 
 The most admitting trait, your turning away 
 Avert your eyes and hush your struggling thoughts 
 Detachment assumed as life mutates into decay 
 The most manifest sign, your disregard 
 The one apparent fault, your shunning of care 
 Contempt now bred, refed and will sustained 
 Division now groomed, nurtured and will maintained 
 Apathy, opprobrium 
 Virulence and animosity 
 This sums you up 
 Betrayal, disunion and fear, isolation 
 Caught in this endless spiral, locked equilibrium 
 A stasis founded in this atrophy of thought 
 Your eyes unflinching, unaffected by the misery 
 Gone is commiseration, gone is any sympathy 
 One last farewell to perspicacity 
 Final surrender to futility 
 Dissociation, severance 
 What have you done? 
 What have you become?
########### Catatonic Transfixion ###########
Trapped in a gaze where time stands still 
 Connected to a blur sensations deformed 
 We are to drown just to become 
 Another set of eyes among the millions 
 Enchanted we fade, selecting illusions 
 Dwellers of the scene, a new world obsessed 
 Gods of displays divine screens 
 Radiate us, now your blessing 
 Down kneel to shields of glass 
 To the sovereign 
 Bleed for the entity of wavelengths 
 Transfixed yet eyes glowing with delight 
 Delusions of omniscience bred us my liars 
 Mentally drained by the growing leech 
 Fed on our manic desire 
 Oceans of sewage continual 
 Washing into our minds 
 Drowning in wasted integrity 
 With eyes too open to see vanity 
 Engulfed in super fiction fields 
 What are we when the false pictures dissolve 
 Caged within a twilight world 
 Devoid of own self made thoughts 
 Stare blind, stare blind 
 Stare blind, stare blind
########### Closed Eye Visual ###########
Unbound to the pale and lifeless day by the 
 Multicolored, multiform 
 A spinning antidream unthought 
 Exceeding the obsolete reality 
 Overheated inner shape-generator 
 Blowing every cerebral fuse 
 Insanity filtered and systematized 
 Feeding the tools of mind abuse 
 Mind-signal transmission peaked, distorted, bent, unrestrained 
 Neuroreceivers shortcircuit. System parameters over-gained 
 Nervethreads decoding the stream of the reality-inverting revolution 
 The patterned untruth of non-dream 
 The closed eye visual delusion 
 A frantic cellular race down the switchbacks of mind 
 Throttling the existence-engine 
 A propulsion beyond all limit lines 
 Convulsive thrusts of septic energy as infected cells collide 
 Unleashing the video-bacterial disease 
 The sinew-conducted pseudo-vision 
 Mind-signal transmission peaked, distorted, bent, unrestrained 
 Neuroreceivers shortcircuit. System parameters over-gained 
 Nervethreads decoding the stream of the reality-inverting revolution 
 The patterned untruth of non-dream 
 The closed eye visual delusion 
 Self unfolds like a disintegrating dream 
 All revealed but the sinister cause 
 My lying eyes come apart at the seams 
 Still how could I ever regret the loss 
 The self transformed into wave lengths 
 Reverberating this unyielding dream 
 Lost in this greedy illusion 
 I'm forever devoured by the closed eye visual delusion 
 A twirling visual overload - Explosions of terror and beauty 
 Colors of fear and pain within clash into unanything 
 (A spectra-organic frenzy setting fire to the 
 Neuro-highways of mind 
 Revolving me away from time 
 A soul now rendered unassigned)
########### Only For The Weak ###########
An even strobe a pulse of flashing 
 Hatelights of synthetic souls mass-produced 
 Hammered into shape a sign of times dreams 
 Turn into systems a new way a new breed 
 Implanted in our minds 
 Here i am in the hand of a sterile hate the 
 New control i can not wake I'm not a sleep 
 New intelligence arise in emptied bodies 
 Turgid flesh tested through eternal spastic 
 Fits through not known codes mother 
 Machine in genocide now scorn a dying race 
 Evolution in reverse now it's time for me 
 Changing what am i to be contorted an eternity defeated 
 Programmed to appease you we're symbols of 
 Perfection humanoids ruined by your laws: 
 Destroy erase improve lesson first: sub- 
 Mission we're docile servant dogs our 
 Leashes are your limbs computed deep within 
 Remoted minds controlled our thoughts no 
 More doubts the new way is here disgorged 
 Another thousands fakes that obey to a 
 Circuit skein to vacuum 
 Mechanical thoughts i now conceive no 
 Longer me always to see inanity millions 
 To be units like me eternally human 
 Patterns copied dissected distorted 
 Completed to fit the machine the nerve 
 Fibres give in to cords to the unknown 
 See me be me same contents same machine 
 The currency of ours no more flesh and bone 
 We are to be unaware of what we have been before 
 Evolution in reverse now it's time for me 
 Changing what am i to be contorted an 
 Eternity defeated by the new machine
########### Paradoxical Spiral ###########
Non-physical smothering, asphyxiation by oxygen hands 
 Drowning in the endless sky. An ever-downward dive, only to surface 
 The sawage of indecision, on which all sense of self is afloat 
 The vortex-acceleration a constant. Resolute in purpose its choking flow

########### The Walk ###########
Trotting barefoot, I felt Christ-like. 
 Except I left all the miracles and shit 
 in the hindsight. 
 At the moment, I was only my power and will. 
 A reflective circuit so clear 
 to illuminate the here and the now of my surroundings. 
 Can they show me all the signs that I need? 
 Willing and vulnerable this approach. 
 Attempting to be timid, but I'm soaked in visions. 
 All laws of interpretation disapply. 
 And I behold: All I've known is wrong. 
 It's not the path less travelled, 
 just the path most failed upon. 
 Yet I'm here and I walk. 
 Till the end of my thoughts, 
 where I'll caress the keys to my means. 
 And helm the epic sight of god. 
 (So) 
 Put a little trample in your stride. 
 Walk with me! 
 Embrace the knowledge of how the end 
 is necessary. 
 Revel in the ability to forecast chaos. 
 And kill the variables right at the source. 
 I see dates, I see times, places and lives. 
 I scowl at the bigger picture. 
 The ongoing pattern of impatterns. 
 So ugly. So ineffectual to me. 
 I must do away. 
 I will do away. 
 Black holes converge, 
 to turn space inside out, 
 to flatten all dimensions, 
 to eat the light out of stars, 
 to cause the miscarriage 
 of our cosmic process, 
 to utterly refuse 
 this value of life, 
 and eject the universe. 
 Revel in the ability to forecast chaos. 
 And kill the variables right at the source. 
 I see dates, I see times, places and lives. 
 I slaughter the bigger picture. 
 When there is nothing to see, 
 then you see everything 
 Put a little trample in your stride. 
 Walk with me! 
 The end is necessary.

########### Two-One ###########
We make our luck against faulty lines. 
 This stronghold we have built, and so you wanna be disconnected? 
 Rise the fuck up and see what happens. 
 This is an epidemic, one that will not be stopped. 
 Won't breakdown after, after their heads peak over the hill. 
 Will you put down your weapon? Shelter is coming nowhere. 
 A sky so red and purple, inflammation. 
 Never look past this treason. I am the reason you're still breathing. 
 I picked up his gun, this previous slayed body to bury thousands more, 
 No waste of lead in my magazine. 
 Now-a-days I'm finding more than treason. 
 'Til death, oh pulverizer, you will clean this mess. 
 You pompous fool sitting upon your throne. 
 Infestation to send you home, so you wanna be disconnected? 
 Rise the fuck up and see what happens. 
 This is an epidemic, one that cannot be stopped. 
 So you wanna be disconnected? 
 Rise the fuck up and see what happens. 
 This is an epidemic, one that cannot be stopped.
########### Wormholes ###########
Where will I end up tonight? 
 Maybe that house again 
 Maybe the city by the lake 
 Because when I'm 
 I'm just sleeping 
 I'm fast to escape 
 Relate to feelings in mind, x2 
 This has been 
 This has been a collection 
 I have made 
 I thought that you would have met me there 
 Well I was wrong, I was deceived 
 To believe it now I know it's not real 
 Grab a hold of me 
 As I m falling 
 Right back where I started from 
 Do I know you? 
 Do you know me? 
 I thought I heard you say 
 Meet me down by the lake 
 This has been 
 A collection that I have made 
 Wormholes connecting me 
 Through the ages 
 Because when I dream of you 
 In this house we re in 
 In here with all these fears 
 Lie down and wait for me to grow old 
 Oh, oh sweet child 
 I recognize your face 
 From somewhere I 
 Guess I have seen before, x2 
 I knew it then I'm 
 Back inside my apartment 
 Watching TV 
 Self loathing, chained up on my couch 
 I'm listening 
 Cause now I m so far from home 
 Sir can I ask you something? 
 How the fuck do I get home? x2 
 Wormholes.
########### Through The Trees ###########
The timing was so perfectly performed as I sat in the forest unknown 
 Among you forms of life I have come to know 
 You grow, grow on me 
 Every time we are encountering, x2 
 And that's when I saw them 
 Through the trees come for me 
 Walk me to your home 
 I want to see 
 Where you come from 
 Channel your thoughts 
 Through my body 
 Oh just please 
 Oh please don't judge me 
 That's when they laid me down 
 On the table to rest 
 Sticking devices in my veins 
 I had absolutely no control 
 And as the fluids 
 Injecting, running, inside me, inside me, 
 I looked up at the lights 
 Never wanting to return home 
 They grabbed my chest 
 Penetrating it with a knife 
 I tried to stand up but had no feeling inside me 
 Who are these people? 
 Why am I floating? 
 Yet I am so convinced, of what they do to me 
 Through the trees 
 Their lights bleed 
 You better fucking run and hide 
 That's when the dust dispersed 
 I could see, the treetops emerge 
 Come for me 
 Take me to your home 
 I want to see 
 Where you come from 
 Channel your thoughts 
 Through my body 
 Oh just please, oh please don't judge me.
########### Starstruck ###########
I got used to you 
 I get star-struck when you re in the room 
 I got used to you Gwen 
 Well I got used to this 
 Feeling that you always gave me 
 I keep pushing forward 
 Never looking back 
 We start to realize 
 The challenges of life 
 I keep pushing forward 
 I'll never live this down 
 You won t see me tomorrow 
 On your mouth is 
 Where I d imagine my name 
 We've got this fresh start 
 You re leaving bound tomorrow 
 Last weekend at the lake 
 You're all I thought about 
 No I can't get away 
 Because you re so addicting 
 I can't get away 
 Cause baby you re addicting 
 Well look who runs this town now 
 You try and push me further 
 Welcome to this two way street 
 You know you are not welcome here 
 Spit n shine my badge clean 
 I got used to you 
 And now this feelings gone away 
 You make me want to destroy everything beautiful that comes my way 
 But I got used to you 
 I get star-struck when you re in the room 
 I got used to Gwen 
 Well I got used to this 
 Feeling that you always gave me 
 We re living our lives 
 Swear we know who we are 
 If it's growing up 
 I guess we'll hold on, hold on, 
 Just watch me run 
 Through the crosshairs of your gun 
 Widen that lens 
 Your hand is steady 
 Are you trigger-happy now? 
 Watch me run 
 Through the crosshairs of your gun 
 I'm so sick of this shit 
 Walking up my pathway 
 That's when I knew 
 I got used to you 
 You re starting a war within 
 I feel you crawling 
 Underneath my skin.
########### Intake ###########
Hold my hands. Yes, hold them close so tightly for so long I have felt this fear. 
 Take deep breaths, don't give up here just yet, 
 You swear your endings somewhere near. I was there. 
 Pulling into my driveway, running straight to the front door, 
 As to see her tell my family that he had stopped intake long before. 
 After that coming from every angle, a thousand things running through my head. 
 Didn't expect it now, no, not now, why it's so soon? 
 Yet I'm still poised and offering as I tread the living room. 
 Oh, you held me higher than I thought that I could climb, I'd just say "no". 
 Guilty me. I treated you like shit, and you were all I ever wanted in me, 
 I owe you it too, because I missed my last chance to say that I love you. 
 I caught a glimpse of his legs, collapsed in black leaning over the slaves. 
 A place that I used call home, call my home, 
 In that street that house where I came from. 
 Guilty me. I treated you like shit, and you were all I ever wanted in me, 
 I owe you it too, because I missed my last chance to say that I love you. 
 Hold my hands. Yes, hold them close so tightly for so long I have felt this fear. 
 Take deep breaths, don't give up here just yet, 
 You swear your endings somewhere near. I was there. 
 Pulling into my driveway, running straight to the front door, 
 As to see her tell my family that he had stopped intake long before. 
 Guilty me. I treated you like shit, and you were all I ever wanted in me, 
 I owe you it too, because I missed my last chance to say that I love you.
########### Paid In Full ###########
Oh well now you've wronged me. 
 This is our progress, last year from now we've come so far. 
 Heist completed, you set the boundaries. 
 Taking the throne, claiming the crown. 
 This is a product of who we are, and what we've done here, 
 What you have left so far behind. 
 So here's to progress, here's to the rest of our lives. 
 Do you see what I see here? 
 Products justified by his hate. 
 Motionless and unproductive. 
 Seven souls will dance upon his grave, which will be paid in full. 
 And to continue, get with the program. 
 You've just jumped on the bandwagon. 
 I've got you right where I want you. 
 Yes I've got you in the palm of my hands. 
 A thanking of your own, of your own. 
 A contemporary crook of these digital dollars. 
 Putting a price on what you're worth. 
 You got it, I want it. 
 My friend that's all that matters to me. 
 A worthless legacy, a tryrants trust torn down. 
 How long will it take you to see? (will it take you to see)
########### Limitless ###########
Only time will tell 
 A miss for a match 
 I think you've found the niche 
 Now I am twenty one 
 Young, but still getting older 
 Now I've been wanting more 
 Than what you have taught me 
 To show me the rivers 
 Life living underneath a billboard 
 The sidewalks infested 
 The people of plastic. 
 Ok, so I've been holding out 
 Lying my weight on the door 
 Up above, I've never felt so numb 
 Until I made it out 
 They put a target on your forehead 
 The day that you were born. 
 I've waited my entire life, sitting on the sides 
 Everyday I hear you say that it gets easier with time 
 A life I never ruined, a light to show me out this time 
 And maybe, and maybe I was right all along 
 The day you were born, a solid mark. 
 Do you believe in everything? 
 Do you believe in everything and everyone you meet? 
 Do you believe in everything? 
 Do you believe in everything and everyone you see? 
 The day you were born, a solid mark written on your forehead.
########### Serenity ###########
Inertia stands over me 
 Holding me down on her bed 
 A million lights as they shed off of me 
 I remember the drug waking me up. 
 An insufficient fluid based 
 Down your back 
 Being remembered in waves 
 It meant the world 
 A pioneer expecting the worst. 
 From a pressed colored label 
 You rebuild with your hands 
 A vision I have known 
 To feel the extract underneath the palms 
 In an enhanced nighttime 
 With the weight of viruality 
 Like the sound when planes collide 
 To the ground in my eyes. 
 I lost myself deep within its depths 
 I'll surface with time in the waters where we met 
 You lost your sight 
 So remember how it used to be 
 So get used to me 
 I'll see you on the other side. 
 An insufficient fluid based 
 Down your back 
 Being remembered in waves 
 It meant the world 
 A pioneer expecting the worst. 
 Louise, x2 
 Where I met you 
 Underneath extended stars 
 I wait until the day breaks 
 Will I ever see you again?
########### The Columbian Faction ###########
I am the most unhappy man, 
 I have unwittingly ruined my country. 
 A great industrial nation is now destroyed by its system of credit. 
 We're slowly shattering, silhouettes of a glass society. 
 From the depths of you shed, the diamond. 
 From Wilshire to Grand Central, buildings will crumble, crumble, structures to piles. 
 You tell me this jury, is this dollar loaned to me. 
 Labeled the catalyst, the X amount, and it is recycled back to me, recycled back to me. 
 Live for this vivid vision. A vision I see, 
 A vision for you. x2 
 From my window I could see exploding lights underneath the veil over the speedway. 
 Guilt for it. I punch right through the skies; distilled, pulling the clouds. 
 I see you in a million dimensions, now you are finally found. 
 I wrote all night long. 
 We always did exactly what we were told, 
 They never wanted us to know. 
 I wrote all night long, 
 A vision of a place that we call home. 
 About a lifetime that we once knew, 
 They never wanted us to know. 
 The age of innocence, 
 A vision of a place that we call home. 
 The story of the oversaw, oversaw. 
 Your loyalty means nothing to me. 
 Expect to be stopped, not to be fucked. 
 We try to break the boundaries. 
 My mind is numb, entire cities washed away. 
 This microchip, a new prediction to a contrary, oh!
########### Affirmation Of Ascension ###########
Maintain a perfect picture for a perfect time 
 Everyone was guided towards the truth 
 The message of the entire world would rest on the back of me 
 In the end of it all, it comes down to one or two things 
 And if you got money, then I got money 
 Why would you take credit for what you didn't create? 
 The mission of three hundred solid. 
 We will be given wings 
 Explosions in the sunset 
 Igniting in my mindset 
 Just follow me into the clouds 
 Where we lay all of our secrets down 
 Drop to my knees 
 While we were given freedom 
 Never have I gone this far with any help 
 An honest approach to living 
 And learning about myself 
 Well goodbye for now 
 I'm chasing it down. 
 I've worked so hard to make this moment mine 
 You will hear my voice above the rest 
 You'll watch me shine. 
 Reminiscing of the days 
 Where you used to be someone 
 A shinning spectacle so far from reach 
 Decades later we had encountered 
 A final time 
 I walk in silence passing by 
 Like a diamond 
 Like there is no one left 
 With money to be made 
 Quit lying to yourself and make the move. 
 Let's get one thing straight man 
 Yeah you're filthy fucking rich right? 
 Let's get one thing straight man 
 All my life I've been trying to make money mean something to me. 
 I've worked so hard to make this moment mine 
 You will hear my voice above the rest 
 You'll watch me shine.
########### Behind The Curtain ###########
He hides behind the curtain 
 In the middle of a storm 
 Relax they have your answer 
 Given to you on a platform 
 It's the forty fourth consecutive one 
 To downplay us 
 Deny us our beliefs 
 So with the current status of state 
 I declare a mockery 
 You betrayed me 
 The neighborhoods rise today 
 And that's a fact 
 They made a martyr of the matter in me 
 You betrayed me 
 The neighborhoods rise today 
 And that's a fact 
 They made a martyr of the matter in me 
 The neighborhoods will not run away my honor 
 We were born 
 I have been culture shocked 
 By this modern place 
 This has been their plan for years to come 
 No fathers will roll over in their graves 
 This has been their plan for years 
 The signing of the dead 
 And the bodies you showed me 
 Put me in the plastic box that I paid for 
 The signing of the dead 
 The bodies that they showed 
 Put me in my plastic box that I paid for 
 Kill all of them in front of me 
 Make sure their faces hit the pavement.
########### Edge Of The Earth ###########
To go as far, as far as I can see, at the edge of the earth 
 The continuous sound of lights that have reached the bottom 
 In the middle of the desert I stared patiently to see them touch the ground, 
 Imploding on the cracked mud surface 
 I knelt down underneath the midway, in the millionth sighting. 
 Lets lay back, sitting inside my car, at the edge of the earth 
 I turned my head to the left and I knew I could not be drugged. 
 Orbs with infusion white mirroring the image of a silhouette, 
 At the edge of the earth. 
 And I'm here tonight, underneath the influence, 
 And why can't I find a way out? 
 It's calling me tonight, this secret I have become, 
 At the edge of the earth. 
 You misunderstood the gravity as the weight falls apart 
 You'll watch me walk away 
 I walk away, calm as the wind 
 You'll watch me go.
########### Via ###########
Write me off, I'm going south for the year 
 So take me there, off the map, 
 That no one else could scale. 
 You sat me down, showed me the aeriels that resonate the skies 
 In between the visual lines, encompassing pines 
 In the greenery commons 
 Is it pressed in a book 
 A history unknown 
 An isle of concentrated mineral 
 In elapsed time 
 Directions to locate the fountain of karats 
 The sight of gold. 
 They sat me down on a point 
 And my eyes looked up in texture 
 The illuminating brim 
 A solid trilogy circle 
 Embedded in the rock orbital 
 When I'm gone you know where you find me: here. 
 It was immaculate in its beauty 
 A thousand words could never describe the colored brights 
 Forever, to a shore, 
 Where you can dig the earth and let it run through your hands. 
 As deep as it will glow 
 We savored the last hour with the turning of the sun. 
 A visual shrine 
 Existing with electronic lines 
 An inseparable sign 
 Intertwined with the corkscrewed 
 Manifested woman 
 In front of me, toxicity 
 In front of me, she barely stood 
 Take me there. 
 It was immaculate in its beauty a thousand words 
 Could never describe the colored brights 
 Forever, to a shore.
########### The Mixture ###########
Take a picture of me 
 I'm dying for more 
 I really can't believe this 
 We just all want to be on TV 
 A minute of this face time 
 Tearing down your door 
 Driven by one hundred forms of fear 
 I've been trying 
 To deny this all 
 For too long 
 To keep my mouth shut 
 And it's got me nowhere 
 To expose you 
 I cannot blame you 
 I will not please you 
 I do not need you 
 To do the things 
 That get you off 
 When you tell me 
 The things I have to 
 When you call me 
 I don't want to 
 Out here with a backpack 
 Traveling back tracked 
 When I don't need to 
 It never made sense to me 
 But it always made sense to you 
 And I will still be here 
 In front of you 
 In spite of you 
 So smile 
 As you look in the mirror 
 Give me my receipt now though 
 Fuck this industry 
 Excuse me to death 
 Can we say fuck it ? 
 You can have metal 
 BACK 
 You can have it back 
 I'll say it again 
 I said I'm in it to win it 
 Don't hold 
 Can't you tell that I'm already in the mix?
########### 91367 ###########
I just hit 'em up 
 I'm losing my mind 
 The pressure is building 
 I gambled my life 
 A couple thousand on the dice 
 Scared money don't make no money 
 Watch what you say you can't take it back 
 I'm going in 
 Now watch me double that 
 Have you heard I can't go like that 
 Push it from the back let's just watch it all burn 
 Light it up tonight we'll be taking our turn 
 Push it down and pull it back 
 Cause we love the night and we own the blur 
 Take the nerve back 
 Again I'm high 
 Crawling inside 
 Feeling alive 
 Losing track of time 
 Caught in the cycle 
 The never ending cycle 
 When you're coming at me you better come correct 
 The way she moves it back n' forth 
 (Closing her eyes, she's wise) 
 In front of me 
 Damn'man 
 No we don't kid and play 
 Let me tell you I don't love that bitch 
 I said it, don't forget it, I meant it 
 I ain't playin' around no more 
 I don't love that bitch 
 I said it, don't forget it, I meant it 
 I ain't playin' around no more 
 We came through the back 
 We roll it up 
 Of the party, about to light it all up 
 Another round, give me your best shot 
 Get up let's party 
 About to pour it all down 
 Remember that I never forced it on you 
 Put this gun to your head and pull the trigger now 
 I wanna warn you that you may see red 
 Just let me live 
 Please don't bring me down 
 Come correct when you're coming to me 
 I tell myself, yeah you got this 
 One more pill and she popped it 
 There's no going home 
 No sleep 
 Until the sun rises 
 Take the nerve back
########### Erased ###########
I've been erased from the old me 
 Can you tell me again, can you hold me if I won't lay till the morning sun? 
 It pulls you out and takes you right under 
 I thought you'd hate me, but I needed you 
 I thought you'd hate me, but you needed truth 
 I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me, for losing you 
 I thought you knew 
 That we're cut out of the same cloth 
 Feel like the pages of a story that we can't stop 
 And, now I can't replace you with another thread 
 Take one more step, I'll jump with you 
 I thought you'd hate me, but I needed you 
 I thought you'd hate me, but you needed truth 
 I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me, for losing you 
 I thought you knew 
 Looking back at your building, you came crashing down 
 You'll think I'll forget that 
 Never gonna take it back (you know where I lie) 
 Looking back at your bullshit, I came crashing down 
 You'll think I'll forget that 
 Never gonna take you back (you know where I am) 
 I thought you knew 
 It's hard enough you standing next to me 
 You assumed with every moment explained with you 
 I'll need to know that you believe in me, or just release me into deja vu 
 I! 
 I never wanted you to understand 
 Why!? 
 I want to make you believe in me 
 Believe in me 
 I thought you'd hate me, but I needed you 
 I thought you'd hate me, but you needed truth 
 I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me, for losing you 
 I thought you knew
########### Across The Bed ###########
It's the way that you do me, babe 
 It's what you do to me 
 I move with you so perfectly 
 Take it off as I pull you across the bed 
 From your head to your feet 
 A fever rising vigorously 
 It's getting closer 
 Reminiscing on the lust you know how it was 
 The feeling of the warmth of your breath and your touch 
 Laying in bed with that scent of yours 
 Staying here instead 'cause I wanted more 
 It's the way that you do me, babe 
 It's what you do to me 
 I move with you so perfectly 
 Take it off as I pull you across the bed 
 From your head to your feet 
 A fever rising vigorously 
 This is the coming of the storm 
 Can you feel the form? 
 In perfect patterns in a perfect dream 
 We are starting up a war, starting up a war 
 Intoxicated by the lies we breathe 
 We are duplicitous and insidious 
 You've pushed me further than I've ever dreamed 
 We are starting up a war, starting up a war 
 It should've ended but we just can't leave so far 
 Pick it up and take it down 
 Lose your body in the sound 
 When you cum it gets me high 
 Let me in your world tonight 
 It's the way that you do me, babe 
 It's what you do to me 
 I move with you so perfectly 
 Take it off as I pull you across the bed 
 From your head to your feet 
 A fever rising vigorously 
 Reminiscing on the lust you know how it was 
 The feeling of the warmth of your breath and your touch 
 Laying in bed with that scent of yours 
 Staying here instead 'cause I wanted more

########### Pistol Play ###########
Damn I see you with her 
 There's nothing more than I would like to put this gun to your face 
 I told myself I was finished 
 And I'll pull it in a minute 
 But first I got something priceless to say 
 The memories 
 All the shit that you did to me 
 Nothing else will follow 
 Fuck the sterling, I'll take the gold 
 I've been here too many times before 
 When you see me in town I suggest you run 
 I'm fucking over with you 
 Damn I see you with her 
 There's nothing more than I would like to put this gun to your face 
 I told myself I was finished 
 And I'll pull it in a minute 
 But first I got something priceless to say 
 I hate my fucking friends 
 You fade away as I walk my way 
 You're just a bitch so rotten 
 The thought of you just gets me dazed 
 I hope you go forgotten 
 You'll fucking go forgotten 
 Fucking go forgotten 
 I tried for weeks to be so honest 
 Finally feel my feet against the floor 
 We take the lies from what's upon us 
 I cannot listen to you anymore 
 Looking for something always searching 
 Never got my hands to touch the door 
 But now I see the table turning 
 Forgetting what your face looked like before 
 You fade away as I walk my way 
 You're just a bitch so rotten 
 The thought of you just gets me dazed 
 I hope you go forgotten 
 Damn I see you with her 
 There's nothing more than I would like to put this gun to your face 
 I told myself I was finished 
 And I'll pull it in a minute 
 But now I've said all that I've had to say
########### Vahle ###########
I tried a thousand times to make you feel it 
 Like the days when we had first met 
 But I feel I never moved you 
 What the fuck how did we forget? 
 And in another life would it be different 
 Would we do it all again? 
 And at that would you tell me that you loved me? 
 All alone why should I pretend? 
 Gagged and bound 
 You told me you broke down 
 And I believed everything 
 My love for you was logic drowned 
 Round and round 
 I came all the way down 
 To tell you that I'm really here 
 And I don't wanna waste my time 
 Without you without me 
 And I'm not being honest 
 I get it back to get me off 
 She did me dirty once before 
 But now that's over 
 I had it all in my hands 
 Until you ripped it out again 
 Let it go there's nothing left 
 Underneath the masquerade 
 You got me up all night 
 I wake up in another room 
 You wake up, you're never next to me 
 Oh no, no, no 
 And I'm coming home tonight 
 But this house wasn't built for two 
 If I let you have the rest of me, 
 Would you tell me the truth? 
 I tried a thousand times to make you feel it 
 Like the days when we had first met 
 But I feel I never moved you 
 What the fuck how did we forget? 
 And in another life would it be different 
 Would we do it all again? 
 And at that would you tell me that you loved me? 
 All alone, why should I pretend? 
 I put my trust in you like I had nothing to lose 
 Now I'm all confused 
 Tell me what to do 
 Tell me what to do 
 Tell me what to do 
 I had enough I'm through 
 I put my trust in you 
 I had nothing to lose 
 Tell me what to do with that said 
 I never wanna see you again 
 It feels so flawless 
 The summer in august when we fell in love 
 Looking back remember when we first met 
 The morning dove into my soul made of gold. No 
 How could you be so thoughtless? 
 My lover my goddess I was so in love with 
 How could you be so faithless? 
 Ignore dedication 
 I showed her through 
 Without you without me 
 And I'm not being honest 
 I get it back to get me off 
 She did me dirty once before 
 But now that's over 
 I had it all in my hands 
 Until you ripped it out again 
 Let it go there's nothing left 
 Underneath the masquerade, death
########### Neon Eyes ###########
Unworthy target 
 It'll take you out regardless 
 As I sit here with the television on 
 And the sound off 
 Commercial after commercial 
 I'm so lucky to define it 
 By my self regret 
 As I perceive narcotic 
 Living life always keeping the weight in line 
 But then you see the world just like I do 
 Feed me until I'm sick 
 Drown me out in white 
 Drown me out along with everyone 
 Not even here to fight this fight 
 Burn it all as I sit back and watch discussions 
 Not to be heard when I watch you talk, forget it 
 Neon eyes always seeing the darker side 
 But then you'll see the world just like I do 
 Unworthy target 
 Let me tell you right now 
 He doesn't give a fuck 
 See him walking down the freeway 
 And it's twelve o' clock 
 But I see him standing tall 
 He's held up in an office on the 20th floor 
 He turns it off 
 He turns it all off 
 The power to my city as we know it 
 The power to my city as we know it 
 Fuck, fuck, fuck! 
 On my knees 
 And I worship you with every pore 
 I'd snort it all, I'd snort it all 
 It's called addiction 
 Caught up in the system 
 The friction of feeling constructed 
 Oh I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost 
 Without a depiction 
 My soul's a victim afflicted 
 I know I'm a sick kid 
 Oh I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone 
 Drown me out along with everyone 
 Not even here to fight this fight 
 Unworthy target
########### Up All Night ###########

For i am what has created this five-piece machine. 
 But not this working animosity. 
 Your captain! Your chief! Your leader! 
 Has gone completely haywire. 
 My fucking apologies for being a thorn in flesh, 
 My apologies. 
 Great anticipations to watch this fall as I concur. 
 Having great multitude. 
 Throwing your selfishness back for ourselves. 
 And if all else fails... 
 I hope your savoring my fucking successes
########### Ectortionate ###########
Keep the mouth running in endless cycles. 
 You will be broken before you know what hit you. 
 Consider yourself destroyed now. 
 Theres no possible way your winning this one. 
 Bring numbers, All I need is myself. 
 Tell your assembly line of minions to get ready for the stab wounds. 
 To get ready for the stab wounds. 
 Heres my voice to say thanks for the lack of chance 
 And forcing me to sing "Trophy Scars" to sleep. 
 Your carrying on, 
 Turning everyone against me. 
 When Ive been fucked over more times than I can count. 
 Im not letting this happen anymore. 
 This lesson needs to be learnt. 
 And Im the one thats teaching. 
 Even though I would never hurt you before. 
 I need you to Mark my words... 
 Soon You'll meet your doom

########### Insomnia ###########
Though you can give no more 
 Inspiring false security 
 I've got the reason to alter belief 
 Selfish paintings diamonds mutilate 
 You can't erase the way I'm unappreciated 
 But I can't sleep tonight 
 Embrace of the drink 
 Be hollow swallow the pain 
 Splitting the field 
 All the noise agitates 
 The stars have not aligned 
 In your favor 
 Cross the line of obscenity 
 Look to find a way 
 To love all the past promises 
 To keep you washed away 
 Sever the ties 
 Broken by the black and white 
 Now fade away 
 Laid in the ground 
 Were lost far beyond the clouds 
 Staring in the darks of hell 
 It's me 
 Along the edge of belief 
 A heart always in the stars 
 Will never fade 
 Decay in the ground 
 Were lost far beyond the clouds 
 Pray in the dark for now 
 Prey on the sounds 
 And silence the darks around 
 Reach for a spark of doubt 
 Alive
########### The Walk ###########
Reach into the void, 
 touch the heart of darkness. 
 Reach for the light, 
 and feel the hand of god. 
 The uncertainty of my existence 
 can be decided by choice of a path I must walk. 
 So sick, monotone culprit. 
 Come on down and we'll talk about it. 
 Bow down to the gods, 
 or keep on walking further; 
 on the cusp of our enlightenment, 
 we march! 
 With the sun at my back, I take my first step outside, 
 Shading my thoughts and my perceptions. 
 Done - from the truth I'll never run 
 Be it the light or the shadow 
 I walk in hand with all. 
 Born of nothing, 
 my thoughts are unconditional 
 and I despise the facade of the original martyr. 
 Deep within the void, higher. 
 So you save yourself, 
 and leave this world behind. 
 The violent twisting of the fates. 
 The imminent collapse of our current state. 
 Separate the vacant space 
 from the condensed bodies, without trace. 
 These carbon units can't see 
 what is beyond this entity. 
 So free the souls of those who desire a higher being. 
 Ready the way for a day of the golden age. 
 Born of nothing, 
 my thoughts are unconditional 
 and I despise the facade of the original martyr. 
 Deep within the void, higher. 
 So you save yourself 
 and leave this world behind. 
 Bow down to the gods, 
 or keep on walking further; 
 on the cusp of our enlightenment, 
 we march!

Flashing eyes of heat 
 Vessel through the deep 
 By the son of night 
 Unclean 
 Charon 
 Fear becomes belief for those cannot pay the fee 
 A coin to board the fleet 
 Or one hundred years disease 
 Row 
 But the line it never fades 
 The story is bound to unfold in the end 
 Love of mine, gone forever 
 Say goodbye to the sky 
 Bound by time 
 Enter the ride 
 Absently 
 I will be 
 Motivate fortune 
 Can't escape from the arms of death 
 Along the shore many faces accumulate 
 In preparation for the underworld 
 Single file ghost by ghost 
 The deck fills up to embark on the final sail 
 But the line it never fades 
 The story is bound to unfold in the end 
 Alone we rise and fall 
 Awaiting the day 
 A life coalesced 
 Deep in the silence our fate entwine 
 Create and consciously free the mind 
 So far from where I lost my soul 
 Depart, implore, divine 
 In our minds adventure is always listening 
 Just stay here 
 The world isn't always listening 
 Disappear 
 Suffer in endless doubt 
 Holding on to the memories as they fade away 
 These thoughts and sorrows will not remain 
 These thoughts and sorrows won't remain 
 Row 
 One day we'll meet again 
 In time beyond the end
########### Jetpacks Was Yes! ###########
These walls of time release 
 My eyes move like the drift 
 The cries, they resonate within 
 The fabric tears before me break ties between the kin 
 Reaching for a way out of this dream 
 I waste my breath ascending 
 Fears lead me astray 
 The past brings them to be 
 What's left to carry me... 
 But a memory 
 The dream endures these lies 
 Forever at the edge left surviving alone 
 Reaching for a way out of this dream 
 I waste my breath ascending 
 Fears lead me astray 
 The past brings them to be 
 What's left to carry me... 
 What's left as I wander 
 I've found a world where I am free 
 Inside that which is truth 
 The ground upon which I have grown is not the same 
 The fears they've fallen away 
 Presently I've found I am not alone 
 In a world of infinity sewn 
 Perceive beyond the seam 
 A soul evolves as one
########### Light ###########
In sunshine's view 
 The absence of love 
 Behold what's blinding you 
 Serpent or dove 
 Between uncertainty 
 Tethered wings and captive dreams aren't worth the suffering 
 Open your eyes 
 Devotion deprived 
 Deny the very thing that you've accepted this life is about 
 Listen to my words 
 Defy devotion 
 Sick from the fall behind the wall 
 I demand of you stand up and see 
 Before they saw what I was becoming 
 Before it kept me from reaching.... 
 The light 
 Can't seem to understand it 
 Can't seem to know 
 Listen to this vacant soul 
 The child has lost its way 
 Tension 
 Suffering the hole 
 Something against me 
 I won't try 
 Never 
 Never again 
 I will not remember 
 Between the lines I sing with doubt 
 Behind this will fall 
 Lost in night and day 
 Breathing for me 
 Listen to the way I enter the world 
 In time this lie will become me 
 The things I've done to forget my dying senses 
 Weary from this act alone 
 In vein six days away 
 Return from the fall 
 Return to... 
 The light 
 Can't seem to understand it 
 Can't seem to know 
 Listen to this vacant soul 
 The child has lost its way 
 Just find a ray of light to help me ascend 
 That is the only way

Moments lost searching for a dream that's real 
 From my heart 
 I'd give it all away just to know 
 Drifting away 
 In truth revealed 
 With perfect order life repeating endlessly 
 Light streaming from below 
 This life is reborn 
 From the shadow to the light 
 Moving through the time 
 It's a cycle that repeats 
 Now 
 Forever 
 Don't touch the spinning wheel 
 Risking all of progression just for a little taste 
 But it's so natural 
 Call it human if you wish to save face 
 Losing control 
 Go with the flow 
 Get swept in the undertow 
 Moments lost searching for a dream that's real 
 From my heart 
 I'd give it all away just to know 
 Drifting away 
 In truth revealed 
 With perfect order life repeating endlessly 
 Light streaming from below 
 This life is reborn 
 From the shadow to the light 
 Moving through the time 
 It's a cycle that repeats 
 Where do we go 
 You ask in simple question 
 Let me show you 
 Give me your hand and we shall fly 
 Seeing all from infant eyes 
 Moving all through time 
 It's a cycle that repeats 
 Into better days for dreams

Repose 
 Flesh of the ground deny 
 Kneel and grieve 
 Beseeching to no avail 
 Myth strikes our being 
 Human existence 
 Jaded by its progress 
 Feeding, a manifest of the shadow 
 Redefine the absolute 
 Crashing down 
 Through their eyes 
 One can see 
 Fear sustained 
 Weakened by their minds 
 Caught in disbelief 
 Don't deny 
 All shall see 
 Vacant souls 
 Shaping commonality 
 In this moment we cannot deny what we are 
 Form a memory on turning wings 
 And carve a way to ascension 
 Pray, withdrawn you just weep, 
 Alone, 
 Wait for a chance to grow 
 Culture folds 
 The falling of love 
 The darkness above 
 Repose within our numbers 
 Walking with a taste 
 Transposed image of being 
 Lost beyond the frame, end of days 
 This time all memories surpass 
 Embrace 
 In time all sense of life decays 
 Descend 
 Again 
 All shall return to the sand through forever 
 We cycle again 
 Re-ignite 
 Savior ablaze 
 Never ending 
 Return to me
########### Icarus Lives! ###########
Believe in memories to resurrect me 
 Besieged by falling dreams 
 Hold them tightly 
 Adorn my wings to thee, and use them nightly 
 I'm neither angel nor a demon spawn 
 Though some will call me god 
 Gravity is just a law I've wrought 
 Hear temptation take the sky for all to see 
 Sheer elation to write in history 
 I'm neither angel nor a demon spawn 
 Though some will call me god 
 Gravity is just a feeble plot 
 When I said I'd never kneel again 
 What I really meant 
 Was fucking pull the pin 'cause time is spent 
 I'm neither angel nor a demon spawn 
 Though some will call me god, fuck that 
 Unite with ravens on their shadow flights 
 As my nocturnal right 
 Gravity is just a mortal's vice and plot 
 I can see again 
 And when I said I'd never feel or see 
 Love and sight are last resorts for me
########### Totla Mad ###########
Strip away all the excess components 
 Unveil a picture one sought to hide 
 Personalities are like fiction 
 The derivative truth but with no substance 
 Violence and hate 
 Nourishment territory and mate 
 We are the product of some experiment 
 While most live in ignorance 
 Some can't accept 
 The last thing we see is obsession, depth of insanity 
 Follow the source into the ground 
 Feeling all vibration flow inside of you 
 We create the sound 
 Like the fathers long before us 
 We've forgotten how 
 Sun down 
 Swiftly a less passive creature emerges 
 Mark the august steps 
 We'll shine the way 
 Still the path remains the same 
 Some may find their own way 
 Forever like me, thirst for a pool of consistency 
 Catch a bug for knowledge and the structure comes down 
 A counter intuitive attack 
 Speak no evil and watch it flourish in a current state of madness
########### Ow My Feelings ###########
Lost the way 
 Feel the world below me 
 Painlessly ascend 
 Torn away dissolving the life I know 
 Grasp the light 
 Feel the glow enfolding 
 Exaltation 
 Isolate the answers and truth from lies 
 Loss of faith 
 The path unravels before me 
 Unholy day 
 I'm letting go 
 Void the past, create the new 
 Separate the few because I hold ability to lead astray 
 Now living through every day on the path between the frozen lines 
 Now no one ever will know about this experience 
 Will someone for once step back 
 And gaze upon this world through my eyes 
 Drawn behind the point of view 
 Seal us from the truth 
 On our own the fear of life decays 
 Time alone reveals our fatal aspect of arrogance 
 In life we're not the only ones 
 Free from the walls I'm alive 
 Lost the way 
 The path unravels before me 
 Unholy day I'm letting go 
 Through time these cries distort the view 
 Hopeless misdirection 
 We all defy the chance to know 
 This world is not the one I knew 
 Holding tight to our beliefs 
 Awake to what we have become
########### Zyglrox ###########
Contest to modern theory 
 Incapable of any progress 
 Analyzed, developed 
 Imitating consciousness 
 At least what it seems to be 
 Uniform and unveiling the machine 
 Cut off 
 The silent space 
 Cut off 
 The sense of space 
 I'm aware of ancient myths 
 That signal to our coming 
 Time waits 
 For none to come 
 The dying age of these 
 Of these feeble beings is closing 
 What should we do with their lives 
 Forgive them for trespassing 
 Spare them termination 
 Or let them die 
 Touched by the hand of the creator 
 Tantalizing the will of the maker 
 Subject to a wide array of thoughts emotions 
 Held by this rationality 
 Worlds collide 
 No peace of mind 
 Consciously evolving 
 Conceived in machines 
 Separated by perception of these dreams 
 Elevate this warped sense of reality 
 I can't understand myself 
 The edge of existence holds 
 What we all have feared 
 We curse your creation 
 Die by our hands in vain
########### Racecar ###########
Freedom beyond our control 
 Partition, they break out in endless stride 
 I'm on the floor in travail 
 Faithful days fall 
 Memories hold 
 Free my soul 
 Seeking within 
 The curtain call 
 Fleeing our fate 
 Every step now recalled 
 Down the drive 
 Staying so close 
 Retraction weighs my soul 
 We are thunder 
 We are all the space in tow 
 Now again 
 This happening 
 My handle is honest calculation 
 Free of the pain 
 Seeking the glow 
 We both need it so 
 Time will give way 
 Time will formulate 
 Seeking within 
 The curtain call 
 Fleeing our fate 
 Every step recalled 
 Don't deny 
 Staying so close 
 Creation is our goal 
 We haven't lost our sight 
 These memories ignite 
 Now have we lost our way? 
 We're taking back all that we know 
 Discretion, the only thing that made me incomplete 
 Cast the sail, just to spin this fate 
 Cross the empty sect in flight 
 Pleasant memories 
 Redefined all that's left 
 The sound, it makes me scream 
 I can hear your voice at night 
 (Your light lost in a waking dream within) 
 Freedom is not of control 
 Endless the chase, pushing through 
 I'm so engulfed 
 Falling to strain, but I still persist 
 All that we've never seen 
 Follow the light 
 I'd like to paint this tapestry 
 With our blood 
 To represent the symmetry 
 Following the sickened results of possibility 
 Refuse the violent source and pain that made you 
 Left to deny that it will change with no solitude 
 Let us take this train 
 Leaving form, stretching far beyond what I can see 
 Chasing the race 
 Left to compete 
 My revelation 
 Reaction creates the fall 
 Realize 
 These are broken words 
 Shattered thoughts amend 
 See beyond the only present road 
 Just let go 
 Counsel to ascend 
 See beyond the only present hold 
 Let go 
 Cannot comprehend 
 Leave it all to find a moments love 
 I am 
 Working to be 
 Complete 
 No more adversity 
 Growing consciously 
 My revelation 
 Reaction creates the fall 
 Realize 
 These are broken words 
 Rising on my own 
 Sage advice, embrace wisdom 
 Hang the past and take the helm 
 Fashion a new future to live 
 In your flame 
 I see regret 
 I've awakened 
 To feel a piece of distant past's harmony 
 How could I not see 
 Possibilities and unlimited passion 
 Hello luminescent being 
 Walking outside of my last identity 
 Celebrate 
 For in the end 
 We will meet in equality 
 Seeking within 
 The curtain call 
 Fleeing our fate 
 Every step recalled 
 I see light (in you) 
 I see light 
 I see light 
 (I see light in your eyes)

Somewhere beyond this sight. 
 Nothing so clear. 
 Reaching in endless night. 
 Colors disappear. 
 Separate the air we breathe. 
 Sell the lies we all will speak. 
 Don't ever ask the questions challenging the prophecies. 
 Silent storm. 
 Following the stars. 
 (Silent storm. Following the stars.) 
 Shifting form. 
 Dwell in reverie. 
 Resurrecton in time. 
 We suppress every reason. 
 Through these eyes perception bleeds mortality from my soul. 
 Nothing can change. 
 The reality of it all will never be left for us to find. 
 Somewhere within the glow, enter. 
 We fall. 
 Holding the shadow close. 
 We hear the call. 
 Solace finding even flow in life. 
 Don't ever ask the questions challenging the prophecies. 
 Pleasant this solitude in violent forms and waves. 
 The final blow is struck. 
 Silent storm. 
 Following the stars. 
 (Silent storm. Following the stars.) 
 Shifting form. 
 Dwell in reverie. 
 Moving forward on the path. 
 Deliver us from the daggers in our hearts. 
 (Come back to the human calling.) 
 Pleasant this solitude in violent forms and waves. 
 The final blow is struck.
########### Ragtime Dandies ###########
Thank you for purchasing Periphery's self-titled debut long play record 
 Periphery! 
 On this album you will hear heavy metal, a genre of music from the future 
 Be dazzled by distortion, be bombarded by bass-beats, and jitterbug to djent 
 We're sure you will enjoy such finger-popping tunes as "Light," "Insomnia," and my own personal favorite, "Ragtime Dandies!" 
 These songs and more are played by a talented troupe of traveling troubadours, featuring the likes of Misha, "The Electric Light Bulb" Mansoor, who was voted the 23rd most influential person in "Brown Magazine," and can be found on the cover of this months "Mocha Imporium" 
 And look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Trent Reznor! No, it's Jake Bowen and his seven strings of wonder! 
 Rounding off the trio of stringsman is Alex Bois, the man with the arms of steel and the ass of a skunk 
 On drums is Matt Halpern, the only man who can break three cymbals with one swing of the stick! 
 Our lead singer will be Spencer Sotelo, who's voice goes up like an angel and down like a wounded ox 
 Last but not least is Tom Murphy providing the rumble from down under, and is the only member of Periphery decent enough for the institution of marriage 
 Experience heavy-metal at it's finest. 
 Periphery! 
 Love That Shit!

As we grow 
 With rusty nails in our coffins 
 Among potential of diamonds and pearls 
 The sea of blood fills the crevice between 
 Our lifeless body and the whispers for what we reach 
 Behold as the weather floods the red 
 Time commands of us to meet again, 
 in silence awakening to a higher light 
 If we sever the distance between one another and cross out the fear we learn 
 All are one and nothing's keeping the love in our souls from burning infinitely 
 Now what have we become? 
 An entity of survival. 
 Rotting flesh of the fallen stains our ego. 
 Now the moment is at hand to rise above what was once so prevalent. 
 Folding time within the mortal boundaries lived upon. 
 Moving onward. We will never fade. 
 Fall into another dead end. Will it end the same? 
 Lines are drawn for the rest of the story. 
 If we sever the distance between one another, and cross out the fear we learn, 
 all are one and nothing is keeping the love in our souls from bursting infinitely. 
 This life is one that we must live. 
 The peace once embraced from so long ago sleeps deep within our mind. 
 Stay forever or be erased from the harmonic physical state of being existing in this dimension. 
 Lies are covered, but only for the moment. 
 The blood of the weak will carve the way for the innocent. 
 The blood of the weak will carve the way for the innocent.
########### Frak The Gods ###########
Lives erased 
 Their memories will never surface again 
 Now our plan for domination is at hand 
 Harvest the flesh 
 Enslave the planet they call home 
 For one thousand fucking years 
 This is the age of new direction 
 No one stands in the way of our reign over this sector that has been newly claimed 
 I'll evade the sun 
 This life is given to those in the shadows 
 Now I must erase the sight of the living 
 And seperate from the eyes 
 Swallow the ink down 
 Might as well, we're all destined to fall off the pages we've written 
 Call it fate or whatever the brain will label it as 
 While we return to the planet 
 Reason with the body 
 The death isn't what it seems 
 We are now the ones to be extinct 
 Only forgivness can end this 
 Death it seems 
 Death it seems 
 So imminent 
 There is nothing that can be done here 
 Suppressing 
 Suppressing 
 The impending destruction of our race as we know 
 I'll evade the sun 
 This life is given to those in the shadows 
 Now I must erase the sight of the living 
 And seperate from the eyes 
 Eyes from around 
 They gather in disbelief 
 Of the air we breathe 
 And the little we know of it 
 This is a time for evaluation 
 Collecting the mind of a conscious infinity 
 Accepting the consequence of the ignorance 
 Changes how you perceive 
 Within this a truth and a reason 
 Met with distaste 
 Falling from the heavens above 
 We've been 
 We've been dethroned 
 Our lives must replay 
 In hope of ascending peacefully 
 Let the violence bring us home 
 Take us away from what we know

These walls of time 
 Release 
 My eyes move like the drift 
 The cries 
 They resonate within (within) 
 The fabric tears before me 
 Break ties between the kin 
 Reaching for a way out of this dream 
 I waste my breath ascending 
 Fears lead me astray, the past brings them to be 
 What's left to carry me? 
 But a memory 
 The dream endures these lies 
 Forever at the edge left 
 Surviving 
 Alone 
 Reaching for a way out of this dream 
 I waste my breath ascending 
 Fears lead me astray, the past brings them to be 
 What's left to carry me? 
 What's left as I wander? 
 I've found 
 A world where I am free 
 Inside that which is truth... 
 And what of this illusion I've come to know? It's not the same 
 Holding back the distant memories to stay whole 
 Presently I've found I am not alone 
 In a world of infinity sewn 
 Reaching for a way 
 I've reached for a way out of this 
 I waste life like it's nothing but a fantasy 
 Fears lead me astray, the past brings them to be 
 What's left to carry me?

With or without a choice 
 To confront every vice without a voice 
 Don't deny your will to live is shattered 
 And your hope is a jaded lie 
 The quality within 
 Will shape the path we choose 
 All this time to call the things they did a lie 
 Keep it to yourself so I 
 Can shove the dark aside and I won't 
 Have to tear the honesty 
 From everything we used to be again 
 The quality within 
 Will shape the path we choose (we choose) 
 The quality we lose 
 Will form the grave we use 
 Legions are sent from the negative elite 
 Sucking life from the world we live 
 Shading the knowledge of oneness and 
 Feeding the shadow within the abyss 
 Found internally 
 Strength to change our misery 
 Shining light carves the way for their demise 
 Dissecting the patterns in our own lives 
 To sift love from experience 
 Remember why we have come 
 Silently ascending 
 Heeding the universal call (as we grow) 
 The shadow cast is nearing its retreat 
 We are now in the time of the fall 
 Silently ascending 
 Heeding the universal call (as we grow)

########### Muramasa ###########
Somewhere in time, we welcomed in the fall. 
 But in the distance we can see shining clear 
 our demise to be; we're not listening to ourselves. 
 You ask these questions in subconsciousness, but still 
 we choose to deny the flood surrounding nations. 
 Wake up! The water is rising now! 
 We are the universe inside of you waiting patiently. 
 All the world by a thread? 
 Distance the lies that are sold. 
 They will not justify the pain. 
 They will not live to see the day.
########### Have A Blast ###########
Caught in the mundane. The day to day, it traps us so tightly. 
 Escape the cubicle cell enslaving time of the resident slave. 
 Just another clone stamped in the system who cannot think for yourself. 
 (Oh, shit!) 
 It's raining pens and staples on the prisoner questioning 
 our real purpose. 
 Bury your sense of worth -- beneath the desk you call your home. 
 Consistent overflowing with no way out. 
 Now you're always entertaining thoughts meandering. 
 Ambition slowly rolling, steady, downhill. 
 A puppet never disobeying the strings attached from hands to toes. 
 From head to fucking toes! 
 And it's the thrill of life that enables us to flow. 
 Locked in the spirit's line, souls entwine, to journey on as one. 
 I guess it's the fear of all that keeps us on the road. 
 Locked in the spirit's line, souls entwine, to journey on as one. 
 Behold our creation... A walking dead. 
 Step back and realize what you are fed. 
 Escape the mortal mentality. 
 It's a lesson that can't be ignored for long. 
 My destination, it lies within the song. 
 (Come on!) 
 Blistering reality. Imagining a world in limelight. 
 Never will it be out of my reach. 
 I've heard the lies a million times, but did it ever steal from my soul? 
 Bleeding from the lungs, I see, a life complete above the darkest hole. 
 And it's the thrill of life that enables us to flow. 
 Locked in the spirit's line, souls entwine, to journey on as one. 
 A world so masochistic. Envious, broken system. 
 The infant braving infested waters, collecting prominent rage. 
 Torment in reality, for I leave it.

Connect these signs. The evidence will 
 lend itself to be more than just a lie. I'm 
 not asking much, just a simple request 
 that you think for yourself, once in this 
 goddamn life. Fuck! 
 Forward. The violent state of mind 
 obsolete and taking the back seat. Reach 
 for the stars, control the fucking skies. 
 Can you silence your opinion of what I'm 
 about to say? Go on and let the mind 
 perceive. 
 Neglect the sense of ignorance to alter 
 life. Embrace the beauty from inside. 
 WE ARE ONE. 
 We are the strength of the universe at 
 heart. Construct the light. Implore of the 
 energy, bestow the understanding. 
 Follow the scent of the sinners as the 
 body of our mind disintegrates. Forever is 
 the course upon your plate. Don't ever 
 ask if we consume the blood and hate. 
 Repeat this life if you will, but don't count 
 on forgiveness from the filthy swine. 
 Here we stand at the threshold of 
 paradise, stealing a new world. I never 
 would have thought our place in history 
 would come to this, but we are infinite. 
 WE ARE ONE.

A race suppressed by oath and seal. The 
 Ancient tribe, it groans. This cold life 
 released us from the physical plane of the 
 human race. Closing the lines. Pave the 
 way, to destroy the light of their day. 
 Disgusting, thriving on the sun. Teeth they 
 grind, waiting for the planets to align. Take 
 back what belongs to the dominant being. 
 Congregate spilling blood. 
 We are the dark, that feed upon the living in 
 solid shadow. Conquer the earth, and bleed 
 the carbon masses in solar shadows. 
 As the cool wind blows, feel the ice grazing 
 over skin. On a chilled horizon, rides the 
 destiny of our poor and foolish kind. 
 From the sun into the deep, we go. Leaving 
 all known from above this lightless world. The 
 humans sleep, while violently commanding 
 "darkness flee the dream." Forboding waves, 
 unclear, crash on seas. Drawing night. 
 We are the dark, that feed upon the living in 
 solid shadow. Conquer the earth, and bleed 
 the carbon masses in solar shadows. 
 Dimensions collide, while the creature 
 resides inside of us all. There's something 
 evil pulsing to life that has been repressed by 
 civil tides. Open the barrier lines. A race 
 suppressed by their repeal. The ancient tribe 
 still groans. Emotion receding as the beast 
 grows. We boast the dark, unholy, presence 
 abound.

So many reasons why one should never entertain the taste of the red 
 A cry for a life of innocence escapes her 
 So repent, and go running back to kill because it might make it easier 
 A fear that keeps you chained down to the ritual, adhere 
 You're a slave born into a dark world of deceit 
 A slave that's longing for a retreat 
 Learning to love a disaster 
 Direct your soul in the essence of light 
 To draw the blood of the master, flee 
 The stains on your wings now carry the free 
 Selfishly embrace the glory vengeance brings 
 Hold courage tight 
 Illuminate the night 
 Punishment! 
 An eye for an eye, a knife for the wicked 
 Just the sight of the organization burning to ashes 
 Could put a smile on her face 
 And end the torture that's within this wretched place 
 So please forgive what I've become 
 Learning to love a disaster 
 Direct your soul in the essence of light 
 To draw the blood of the master, flee 
 The stains on your wings now carry the 
 Golden seal 
 Extracted from the omen's life 
 One steady hand in victory 
 Darkness weeps 
 As love enfolds under a pure and crescent night 
 Born from the eye into the light 
 So many reasons why one should never entertain the taste of scarlet

Staring up at the ceiling 
 While I'm falling into the flames 
 Something's gnawing 
 My shoulder and scarring 
 This moment into my memory frame 
 The fathers speak, but might as well be castrated 
 It feels so good from where I stand 
 The one abstaining from all human needs and pleasantries 
 Is the one I never will be 
 Collecting through the sheets 
 A sense of power filling me, and I will never let go 
 I'm never letting go 
 Bending will of man and the hearts of the gods 
 Shut the fuck up and let us live a life we can call our own 
 Leave me alone 
 If you love the guilt then let it die 
 A life kept so clean, will measure the price of misery 
 If you love the guilt then let it die 
 In silence we will remain 
 If you love the guilt then let it die 
 A life kept so clean, will measure the price of misery 
 But manifest the taste of paradise and surely you'll see 
 The sin inside of me
########### Ragnarok ###########
Forty days and nights I've spent alone. The shadow hungry angel inside of me grows cold. Bloodshed on my mind. A slave to these walls. Get away from the life sucking call. Set me free. 
 Grant a pardon for the meddling soul. The lives of the fallen deserve to take the spirits toll. Within the asylum of a guilty fucking conscience (I feel) I feel the presence of insanity creep up my spine - to lock me away in this hell. 
 Death has made its abode on my shoulders. It clings to the palm of my hand eternally. Within ascendance I shall relive the slaughtering. You'll sing to the dirt, praying for the break of dawn. 
 Night will bring the presence of a ravenous demon setting out to terrify. Soul destructive like imploding stars. There's nothing but the darkness to guide the way. There's nothing left inside. 
 Scald the inside. Fold the endless search within you. Scale the insight, for the day it lies before us. Somewhere in time... Off in the distance we can see, shining, clear, our demise to be. We're not listening to ourselves. 
 Somewhere in time, we welcomed in the midnight leave. But in the distance we can see, shining, clear, our demise to be. We're not listening to ourselves.
########### The Gods Must Be Crazy! ###########
Heart stop, and carry on through the light. Can you tell me what I'm missing? This sleep sought after twists the dagger in the question of what lies within. So heart stop beating on through the night. Give an escape for the blinded. Although I follow, it seems to pass the time. I wait with certainty inside this theory. 
 I hear them speak with tongues of fire, while setting the heavens ablaze. Live a life high up on a wire of fear. 
 It's not for me to say what you need to believe, and I won't speak until it's over. It's not for anyone to say what it is to perceive. Steadfast, wallow in their punishment. Take pleasure in the sight. 
 False cries. Corrupting the soul of a saint and with knowledge of gods we relate. Watch from afar, dodging religious scars. 
 Disregard my existence? Don't ignore me! 
 Speak of forgiveness in sin? I bathe in your hatred so putird and crimson. Never an ounce, never an inkling of repentance do I give. Throw it away. Piss on the demons and their hypocrisy. 
 It's not for me to say what you need to believe, and I won't speak until it's over. It's not for anyone to say what it is to perceive. Steadfast, wallow in their punishment. Take pleasure in the sight.
########### Make Total Destroy ###########
Welcome to the truth; a life that's not your own. 
 Controlled by labor, printed paper and the corruptors of the world. 
 Synthetic lies collect our minds to the beast. 
 We've had the rug pulled from under our feet. 
 Media terrorists thrive on deceit, 
 spoonfeeding bullshit served by elite societies harnessing fear as a weapon. 
 The time has come for all to see, 
 the man behind the curtain cast into disease. (into disease) 
 Take back the light. 
 It's a dangerous place we're headed for if we accept defeat. 
 Now we know it's a show they've been running from below. 
 Burn it down until the ground beneath the faulty entity is glistening 
 under the wings of a golden era. 
 Listening to the hate they've created inside us, we grow. 
 As we reduce their religion to bones. 
 Yes, we reduce them all to bones. 
 The time has come for all to see, 
 the man behind the curtain writhe in self defeat. (defeat) 
 When will the world seek truth within? 
 The eye in silence grants the knowledge to begin. (to begin) 
 Reverse what's lost awake the song within you. 
 Rejoice aloud. Let these words imbue. 
 Reverse what's lost awake the song within you. 
 Rejoice aloud. Let these words endure. 
 Shape the future. 
 Sifting power back in the hands of the common man. 
 Give them hell for existence. 
 Pouring blood on the path they've set in stone, 
 as we reclaim our position to the throne. 
 Yes, we reduce them all to bones!
########### Erised ###########
There's a vessel and it's sinking at sea 
 An apparition that's beckoning me 
 As the cold dark night brings on the sweat 
 I slowly drift away 
 Stuck down in the bottom of your cylindrical state of mind 
 What are we riding from 
 There's a distant sound of a melody 
 Release me from this plane 
 A life to live 
 A sedative under the skin 
 Bury it, carry the cure 
 Just let emotion set devotion within your heart to collect the death we sow 
 Step out from the moonlight like it's a game we play 
 The checkerboard is tainted drops of red will lead the way 
 Black are the lies 
 Gold are the tongues of the glorified 
 Command disease of the body and mind 
 Stuck down in the bottom of your cylindrical state of mind 
 What are we riding from? 
 There's a distant sound of a melody 
 Release me from this plane 
 A life to live 
 A sedative under the skin 
 Bury it, carry the cure 
 Just let emotion set devotion within your heart to collect the death we sow 
 A life to live 
 A sedative 
 A life to live 
 A sedative under the skin 
 Just let emotion set devotion within your heart to collect the death we sow 
 Collecting sanity, simply ready for the life that waits surely 
 There's a distant sound of a melody and I won't leave this place
########### Froggin' Bullfish ###########
Shut out from this ancient truth. We are blind inside. Migrant souls from a distant world? There's an absence of knowledge. 
 Reaching out for the pulse of our own. Now the time has come to awaken the prophecy. Buried underneath the veil of illusion. Given a life of freedom, only to neglect what we should feel. Tortured by negative consciousness. 
 Feeling our disorder hit the froggin' wall. Escape some way... Awake! Hallucinating desire. 
 Chase the obscene. Travel these wonders far beyond. Burn down the walls that bind you to this cage, or be detained. 
 For once, a glimpse at freedom would feel divine. A break from this feeble old mind. My fucking mind! 
 Negative scenes are just the projection of our own dark fear. Playing the victim is not what will bring us back to salvation. Back to reality. 
 What is it they all seek? Be it the wealth or the throne? Live your life as a drone! Reaching out for the pulse of your own. 
 So high... above what they all seem to know. Subliminal signs; a message that's unrefined. Soaring above what they all seem to know. Someday replay the purgatory life you lead. 
 Taste the obscene. Travel these wonders far beyond. Burn down the walls that bind you to this cage, or be detained.
########### Mile Zero ###########
It starts as one festering feeling 
 The kind that cuts from the flesh down to the soul 
 No way to make amends for the time behind the door 
 Street lights feed lies straight to the mind of the wishful wanderer 
 How could he give up? 
 No second chances to say goodbye. 
 Wrapped in this cold, nostalgic energy from the cries of the ones who are 
 Buried 
 Ascend beyond. 
 Life is ruthless and chock-full of pain. 
 It lifts you up, leaves you out in the rain, 
 And it hurts just to know that you're not coming back again. 
 I will miss you my friend 
 Memories like a slug to the brain 
 Paint the walls with a love that will stain the darkest of nights 
 You left to join the stars and I cannot shake this off my chest. 
 In death we grieve until all have transcended from this realm 
 In time we will meet again. 
 Suddenly I can feel the connection between dimension ties 
 Open gut on the floor. Trembling down to the core. 
 What is this? 
 It's been a long ride without you 
 I'm lost inside my own world. 
 There's not a single day where I've feigned the acceptance, 
 But it's a somber stroll down this road that we call life. 
 The silence still is crawling out of my sedated sight. 
 How can I be free? 
 Wrapped in this cold, nostalgic energy from the cries of the ones who are 
 Buried 
 Ascend beyond. 
 Life is ruthless and chock-full of pain. 
 It lifts you up, leaves you out in the rain, 
 And it hurts just to know that you're not coming back again. 
 I will miss you my friend 
 Memories like a slug to the brain 
 Paint the walls with a love that will stain the darkest of nights 
 Left to journey alone, but I can find my way back home.
########### Masamune ###########
As I slip away... thoughts rushing through me. Angelic call? Or a demon that's calling my name? Enter the intrepid state. Enter beyond what is seen to the spiritual stream of the vacant. 
 Shot from the mind of the physical, leaving flesh behind. Rejected by the holy gates. I will not be directed! The course of ancient power, it will follow. Fall with me. 
 (Fucking grim and frostbitten.) 
 Dark and grim for a memory. Measuring all the glory as it seemed. Was it enough for eternity? Foolish schemes for a destiny lined with dreams all came crashing down on me. What will become of the energy? 
 Cast away. I feel the heavens slowly turning gray. Colours seem to fade. As the morning star surrounds the angels sing. 
 Salvation is so far from unholy realms of the filth infestation. Torture the life death-bound in wretched ways. Repent or revenge? 
 There's no pardon for a meddling soul. Somewhere in time we welcomed in the fall, now in the distance I can see shining, clear, our demise to be... 
 We're not listening to ourselves.
########### The Heretic Anthem ###########
8...7...6...6...6...5...4...3...2...1... 
 I'm a pop star threat and I'm not dead yet 
 Got a super dred bet with an angel drug head 
 Like a dead beat winner, I want to be a sinner 
 An idolized bang for the industry killer 
 A hideous man that you don't understand 
 Throw a suicide party and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap 
 It's evilsonic, it's pornoholic 
 Breakdowns, obscenities, it's all I wanna be 
 If you're 555, then I'm 666 
 If you're 555, I'm 666 
 If you're 555, I'm 666 
 What's it like to be a heretic? 
 If you're 555, I'm 666 
 What's it like to be a heretic? 
 Everybody's so infatuated 
 Everybody's so completely sure of what we are 
 Everybody defamates from miles away 
 But face to face, they haven't got a thing to say 
 I bleed for this and I bleed for you 
 Still you look in my face like I'm somebody new 
 Toy - Nobody wants anything I've got 
 Which is fine, because you're made of 
 Everything I'm not 
 If you're 555, then I'm 666 
 If you're 555, I'm 666 
 If you're 555, I'm 666

 If you're 555, I'm 666 
 What's it like to be a heretic? 
 Heretic! 
 Yeah! 
 30 seconds, 16, 8, 4, let me tell you why 
 I haven't the slightest, I'm teaching your brightest 
 They're listening, clamoring 
 All the money in the world can't buy me 
 Go ahead, lie to me 
 Tell me again how you're tortured 
 I wanna know how you followed your orders so well 
 You're full of shit 
 You had a dream, but this ain't it 
 If you're 555, I'm 666 
 If you're 555, I'm 666 
 If you're 555, I'm 666 
 If you're 555, I'm 666 
 If you're 555, then I'm 666

########### The Summer Jam ###########
Cut up the planet for an illusion 
 Home isn't far from where the resource is 
 Fusing distant lands 
 A sign of life is steadily ending 
 Call out so desperate for a way 
 The cries are readily sending 
 They beg of night to release the day 
 They're calling out for a better way 
 (Cut up the planet for an illusion) 
 Coldest nights sometimes give way to brightest skies of blue 
 Moving onward carrying the life that's in plain view 
 And we will carry with a thriving few 
 Corrupt the planet for evolution 
 Though what we see is not the fault of man 
 Only leaps and strides 
 Cut up the planet for an illusion 
 Home isn't far from where the resource is 
 Hoping for a better way 
 Conjure a way to the heavens and suddenly 
 We suddenly ask ourselves if this light is worth the lie 
 Conjure a way to the heavens and suddenly 
 We suddenly ask ourselves if this light is worth the lie 
 Coldest nights sometimes give way to brightest skies of blue 
 Moving onward carrying the life that's in plain view (plain view) 
 And we will carry with a thriving few 
 Corrupt the planet for evolution 
 Though what we see is not the fault of man 
 Isn't far from where the resource is 
 Stripped of ground by the hands of those who have built 
 A life surrounding causing quarantine 
 Reach for skies 
 Reach for a belief that this life equals something 
 Conjure a way to the heavens and suddenly 
 We suddenly ask ourselves if this light is worth the lie 
 Conjure a way to the heavens and suddenly 
 We suddenly ask ourselves if this light is worth the lie

Cold embrace, like these old wings set ablaze 
 Old wings set ablaze 
 Summon the violence to end our pain, call out 
 Two future brethren will erase the stains 
 Tonight we'll eradicate the deacon 
 We'll put the lights out and bend to their knees 
 Ignite the flames and burn with rage 
 Shots fired and I've got a fucking reason 
 To suffocate when the breath leads to treason 
 Cut the ties 
 Collect whats mine 
 Burn everything and feed the fucking ground 
 Bound by fate, all lives stain 
 Last chance to medal with the agony 
 Now choose your side

Constant is the parade of ashes 
 Keep the distraction, bat those lashes

 Murder the innocent 
 We're digging us a deeper hole 
 Catastrophic creations, oh 
 Destroy, erase the masses 
 Festering vessels line the caskets

########### Pale Aura ###########
Walking through water as it dampens our feet 
 Watch as we call in self-defeat 
 The trees are calling to the man in the mask 
 They know his true identity, identity 
 Come and stare 
 Come and stare at her love through these eyes 
 From a mountain so high 
 Is it possible we've forsaken our Mother? 
 Return to nowhere 
 And nature will know my name 
 This is what it takes to feel at home 
 In her soul that's beyond light is where I lay (I lay) 
 Until the dusk of man 
 Yes he squanders the life he leads 
 Still the end will call 
 Birth of anti-bionic seed 
 Will he grow with fault? 
 Grow with fault 
 Come and stare 
 Come and stare at her love through these eyes 
 From a mountain so high 
 Is it possible we've forsaken our Mother? 
 Return to nowhere 
 And nature will know my name 
 This is what it takes to feel at home 
 In her soul that's beyond light is where I lay (I lay) 
 Until the dusk of man 
 When it snows 
 Do you feel the love? 
 Wind, it blows 
 Through our bodies 
 Return to what we know
########### A Black Minute ###########
Our voices echo on a quiet night 
 Silver faces, an unholy cathedral 
 Moon and sun 
 A birthing rite in this duality 
 Embrace the feeling of our human skin intertwining now in ecstasy 
 Lie in the circle of a few who stain our bodies with their own blood 
 The blessing is given as the child grows 
 A family burdened with a line full of evil 
 Sacrifice 
 Now you can live to see another day 
 Embrace the feeling of our human skin intertwining now in ecstasy 
 Lie in the circle of a few who stain our bodies with their own blood 
 Our voices echo on a quiet night 
 Silver faces, an unholy cathedral 
 Moon and sun 
 A birthing rite in this duality 
 These voices echo so violently 
 A congregation with a line full of evil 
 Sacrifice 
 Now you can live to see another day

Innocent babe, shall we corrupt at such a young age 
 Conjure a laugh 
 Conjure the tears amongst love 
 Glass brain, it will project all of the spectrum 
 Heart still, but his infant hands are shaking now 
 Start leaking all the thoughts on your mind 
 What's yours, is ours for the taking 
 Take this bruise as a sign that we own you now and forevermore 
 Spiral down 
 Disconnecting sight from sound 
 Control one 
 Innocent babe, shall we corrupt at such a young age 
 Conjure a laugh 
 Conjure the tears amongst love 
 Take this bruise as a sign that we own you now and forever 
 The poison now is your responsibility 
 You can finger-paint with blood on your hands 
 Take this bruise as a sign that we own you now and forevermore
########### Heavy Heart ###########
Experience these things 
 My chest sinks further in and it gets hard to breathe 
 Don't fight it, make this easy 
 Sometimes I wish I had wings 
 Fly far away from this life 
 It's a long road 
 As the water beads upon the window, turn the sad song up on the radio 
 Such curiosity 
 These thoughts go on all day 
 It takes hold on me, but fighting isn't easy 
 Sometimes I wish I had wings 
 Fly far away from this life 
 It's a long road 
 As the water beads upon the window, turn the sad song up on the radio 
 Will the voices haunt when the flesh moves on and the clouds block out the rays? 
 When the feeling hangs upon a halo, I can only try my best just to let it go 
 What's left with me is a memory and the things I have to say 
 Resting now, their bodies hit the ground 
 Nightmares creep over me 
 I hear the sounds 
 Children scream, their mothers bleed hung upside down 
 Scarlet robes and sadistic minds surround me 
 I've spent all of my life confined in secrecy 
 What you see is but a shell of what I am on the inside 
 Clouds of blackness strike lightning 
 There's nothing above 
 I'm falling below 
 As the water beads upon the window, turn the sad song up on the radio 
 Will the voices haunt when the flesh moves on and the clouds block out the rays? 
 When the feeling hangs upon a halo, I can only try my best just to let it go 
 What's left with me is a memory and the things I have to say
########### The Scourge ###########
As I sit with eyes heavy, omens clear 
 Face down in seclusion 
 The evils steer what drives the stake within my heart 
 This man, he fell apart 
 Now that the entrance is open wide, this black all around makes its way inside 
 What have you done? 
 Will hate abide? 
 Where is my death invitation? 
 Elation? 
 Dead wind swirling beneath these prayers I hide 
 I'd give my life for a taste of what lies beyond in that place now 
 Live Earth rising beneath these hands untied 
 I'd leave my life on the line 
 Never one of them 
 I am not free 
 Survive 
 I will survive 
 Glass ceilings above drop rage upon them 
 Stone cold fist and a memory 
 Running on the blunt end of a blade 
 The blood that it spills shall start my serenade to you 
 I will survive 
 Survive

It's always better on the other side of it 
 Wanting what you never have 
 It's a goddamn broken state of mind that we've been living in 
 It's never greener inside the mess we're in 
 Wanting what you never have 
 The less we are content the more we throw away what little time we have left to grow 
 Separate mind from me, but still I have no adamant will to leave 
 What little time we have 
 Stop bleeding on the inside 
 We are alive, and it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white 
 Can we show the ones who are blind? 
 It's envy eating away at the core of us 
 Wanting what you never have 
 Isn't it the point of living to breathe 
 Knowing this is all we need 
 It's never greener inside the mess we're in 
 Wanting what you never have 
 The less we are content the more we throw away what little time we have left to grow 
 Separate mind from me, but still I have no adamant will to leave 
 What little time we have 
 Stop bleeding on the inside 
 We are alive, and it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white 
 Can we show the ones who are blind? 
 Show them that we're not blind! 
 We're not blind! 
 Stop bleeding on the inside 
 We are alive, and it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white 
 Can we show the ones who are blind? 
 Fly passed the withered trees 
 Ascend to holy air and breathe 
 (Separating) 
 (drive me crazy) 
 (Separating mind) 
 This want is menacing and will not leave us be 
 Can we purge this? 
 The bastard in our brain will chew until it bleeds 
 How did we get like this? 
 Step out in the rain 
 Feel life in our veins
########### 22 Faces ###########
Staring at the hourglass 
 My life it feels like a machine running with no direction 
 Watching time as it draws a perception obscene from a resurrection 
 Choking on reality 
 The walls of my insides; they bleed from the excess incisions 
 Drawn and quartered by the monster who pulls on the strings from the core of me 
 I'm dying to see what it is that is eating away at me 
 Now the stars are the sun in my world 
 They burn from the inside out 
 Ice cold in the flames burning all around 
 So blind to the beauty of sleep 
 It feels like the walls are melting, freezing into me 
 Have I lost track of time? 
 Why can't I feel the burn? 
 Staring at the hourglass 
 My life it feels like a machine running with no direction 
 Drawn and quartered by the monster who pulls on the strings in my resurrection 
 I'm dying to see what it is that is eating away at me 
 Now the stars are the sun in my world 
 They burn from the inside out 
 When the frustration makes a move, the second hand will swallow you 
 It's tearing a hole inside 
 I'm buried alive 
 The smell of flesh is seeping into my range 
 Thrashing, hoping for a better way 
 The push, the pull, it's tearing apart my will to thrive in the day 
 Pins and needles jabbing into my veins 
 On the verge of losing sanity 
 The beast tears and I can't do a thing about it 
 I'm dying to see what it is that is eating away at me 
 Now the stars are the sun in my world 
 They burn from the inside out 
 Fuck me, I am dying for sleep 
 What is exactly is eating away at me 
 Now the stars are the sun in my world 
 They burn from the inside out

Further down this road 
 Where is it that we are leading the generation we know? 
 The answers lie down inside the mind of humanity 
 It's a vast, dark sea 
 Will we fall forever alone, down in this unknown abyss? 
 Where we fail is thinking our worth is something much more than this 
 Hold your breath 
 We're sinking down for miles in an ocean full of mortal mistake, where the light is much clearer 
 Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck? 
 Further we lower us down 
 The walls are closing in 
 We're cluttering 
 All that is meant for us is lost 
 Bite your tongue 
 Can we search a little deeper for what our actions will cost? 
 Will we fall forever alone, down in this unknown abyss? 
 Where we fail is thinking our worth is something much more than this 
 Hold your breath 
 We're sinking down for miles in an ocean full of mortal mistake, where the light is much clearer 
 Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck? 
 Further we lower us down 
 We set our feeble minds on the bullshit 
 Will we ever escape, from where the light is much clearer? 
 Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck? 
 Further we lower us down 
 Can't we find a place where we finally can think for ourselves? 
 Our thoughts are unspoken 
 We can fly, yes we can soar 
 Staring in the face what we choose to accept, but can't ignore 
 Our thoughts are unspoken 
 Life is knocking at your door 
 This is a calling to the human race 
 We are alone the more we segregate 
 And I won't be part of this in the end 
 Hold your breath 
 We're sinking down for miles in an ocean full of mortal mistake, where the light is much clearer 
 Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?

Silence is bringing on the heart attack 
 Pushing and pulling going on within my brain 
 It says to lay low 
 Dead end 
 The darkness latches on 
 Now I am a product of a mind that wasn't ever mine and now it says "Kill them slow" 
 Weighed down 
 I'm drowning in this stale moment 
 Renown is yelling at me from above 
 This is a one way road 
 Kill them slow 
 Long ago I was forced to drink 
 Now I long for a taste of what stains the murder in red 
 Straight back to the moment of a distant memory 
 Strip away all the empathetic feeling towards a world that has grown absent of all my love 
 Sadistic aura 
 Dead end 
 The darkness latches on 
 Now I am a product of a mind that wasn't ever mine and now it says "Kill them slow" 
 Weighed down 
 I'm drowning in this stale moment 
 Renown is yelling at me from above 
 This is a one way road 
 Kill them slow 
 Stop fucking pulling 
 Will you release the grip and let go? 
 I've got a life to live and a life to end 
 I'll hang 'em up 
 Leave the bloody mess all around 
 Bow my head then calmly walk away 
 Kill them slow!

Their screams will echo on a quiet night 
 Silver faces an unholy cathedral 
 Death has come 
 A sacrifice in this duality 
 The blessing is given as the children moan 
 A man is burdened with a line full of evil 
 Hungry eyes

 I'll end the feeling of a soul within, set it free in bloody ecstasy 
 Lie in the circle of a few who stain their bodies with their own blood
########### The Bad Thing ###########
Sometimes there's a crack in the world that I can peer through to see it for what it really is 
 There's an ugly face staring back 
 Demons are everywhere 
 They draw the hatred from inside of me 
 There were times at the top of the earth that I wish I could throw everyone and everything 
 Watch the mountains snap the necks of the hypocrites 
 I'm bathing in the thought of it 
 The severed dreams of all the weak, quenching thirst inside of me 
 And the scream it holds the key, unlocking this for all to see 
 Fly past the trees 
 Ascend to holy air and breathe 
 Far from the leaves 
 Transcend their fucking boundaries 
 Isn't this desire that you're looking for? 
 Or is insanity just knocking on your door? 
 Give me just a piece and surely you will find, everything is better on the other side 
 Can you look within to find what is in store? 
 This life is but a scream that has become your whore 
 It's tearing a hole inside 
 You're buried alive 
 Sometimes there's a hole in the earth that I can step through to get away from the twisting of tongues 
 It looks a lot like a grave when I'm staring up 
 Feeling the soil creeping over me 
 There were times at the top of the earth that I wish I could throw everyone and everything 
 Watch the mountains snap the necks of the hypocrites 
 I'm bathing in the thought of it 
 I'd like a reason just to help them bleed 
 Give me a reason, come on give it to me 
 Fly past the trees 
 Ascend to holy air and breathe 
 Far from the leaves 
 Transcend these earthly boundaries 
 Isn't this desire that you're looking for? 
 Or is insanity just knocking on your door? 
 Give me just a piece and surely you will find, everything is better on the other side 
 Can you look within to find what is in store? 
 This life is but a scream that has become your whore 
 It's tearing a hole inside 
 You're buried alive 
 I'd like a reason just to help them bleed 
 Give me a reason
########### Priestess ###########
A shadow in these walls... Yes that is all I am 
 A prison deep under fortress grounds where they spill the blood of man 
 A second chance at life is all I've dreamed of 
 For now inside these walls I stay 
 Sitting far away, I watch the blackness grow 
 Never mind what is underneath the stone 
 It's a life that we're living all alone 
 Step out in the rain and feel the deep sorrow 
 Light is calling from the narrow road 
 Sometimes kindness speaks in tongues with one of them 
 I can see love in her eyes 
 If I fall, death will never stain one of his hands 
 I find safety in these lies 
 A second chance at life is all I've dreamed of 
 For now inside these walls I stay 
 Sitting far away, I watch the blackness grow 
 Never mind what is underneath the stone 
 It's a life that we're living all alone 
 Step out in the rain and feel the deep sorrow 
 Light is calling from the narrow road 
 The chains are part of me 
 Stale air is all I breathe down here 
 I need to find a way 
 I'm gonna find my way far from here... 
 Another chance at life is fading slowly 
 Upon the cross I burn 
 Sitting far away I watch the blackness grow 
 Never mind what is underneath the stone 
 This life we live alone 
 Step out in the rain to feel a deep sorrow 
 Light is calling from the narrow road
########### Graveless ###########
I've held the knife to my throat for so long 
 Is it everything I want? 
 This life feels far away 
 Is this the time to let go and settle a life below? 
 Or live another fucking day? 
 Suffocating in a world of human filth 
 Yes pull me under 
 Stop treading in a pool of your own blood 
 Accept demise 
 Let it pour 
 Bleed it out 
 Feel as the life drains from within 
 A smile now rips open and paves a way in my sin 
 I feel Beelzebub inside me 
 He's been here all along 
 Clutching every last ounce of sin from these dried up bones 
 Please strike me down 
 Fuck me... I can't repent 
 By my own hands, I shall bury my own life 
 Let it pour 
 Bleed it out 
 Feel as the life drains from within 
 A smile now rips open and paves a way in my sin 
 My only love is worlds away 
 Thy father bless her and repay the breath they stole with all my hate 
 I drift away now in my sin 
 Let it pour 
 Bleed it out 
 Feel as the life drains from within 
 A smile now rips open and paves a way in my sin
########### Hell Below ###########
Further I'm hurled down 
 The colors shift from red to gray 
 This is a realm of damaged spirits and I can't see the light... 
 Only the gaze of his eyes 
 The demons drag me down 
 Clawing for the heavens, they pull 
 I can feel them violently consuming me 
 No body, no mind, a spirit left to die 
 Finally they've collected me 
 The sound of misery in death has now begun 
 This is over 
 My death has now begun 
 Live, die, burn 
 Fucking live, die, burn 
 Further I'm hurled down 
 The colors shift from red to gray 
 This is a realm of damaged spirits and I can't see the light 
 Only the gaze of his eyes
########### Omega ###########
I see a flash 
 Is this sleep? 
 Am I in a dream? 
 The past sees me and it won't let go 
 Greeted by those I've killed along the way, because I am the destruction 
 The past sees me and it won't let go 
 A demon born out of their rite in throes 
 This is the truth 
 I am a demon born out of their rite in throes 
 Soiled by the world of man 
 I am the destruction 
 I am fear 
 I am sin 
 I am the destruction 
 This memory ignites 
 The past sees me 
 Visions of me grow 
 Greeted by family 
 Painting dissolution and a life of an insect 
 The past it will not let me go 
 I'm lost within my own soul 
 A ghost within times of old 
 The clock turns back, but is this real? 
 Tell me, is this real? 
 A demon born out of their rite in throes 
 This is the truth 
 I am a demon born out of their rite in throes 
 Soiled by the world of man 
 I am destruction 
 I am fear 
 Born to destroy 
 Transcending boundaries of affliction 
 I've learned from past experience I am a monster 
 Disgust and horror flash before me in fire burning down below 
 Holy desire 
 This stain will never wash off of my grave 
 Physical life has wandered 
 Here I stay, in death 
 Take pity on a soul and grant me resurrection 
 Grant forgiveness 
 This is only but a dark reflection 
 Regret is ripping the throat from my neck 
 Now I can't speak 
 I wander 
 Here in death, I weep 
 Take pity on a soul and grant me resurrection 
 Grant forgiveness 
 This is only but a dark reflection 
 Hell bound 
 Past death 
 Nothing can save me 
 Longing for something beyond 
 Embrace the feeling of a soul within 
 Realizing this is what we need 
 Inside the circle that's a mystery to our eyes and what we shall perceive 
 Stop bleeding on the inside 
 We are alive, and it's more than enough to paint the walls that are white 
 Can we show the ones who are blind? 
 Show them that we're not blind
########### Stranger Things ###########
Wandering below the hadean seal 
 Shaking, mortified, making my way back to nowhere 
 This skeletal mask brings a demon of the day 
 There never would have been a light if the messenger in still life had regard for the son of the damaged soul 
 Send the mirror falling 
 Heavens see that this man once had value among all the golden 
 But eccentric revisions in life brought on decay 
 Take submission from a man in control 
 Set the sail blowing, search for peace 
 A loose feeling consuming me 
 Blood is spent 
 A token for my sacrifice 
 Fallen angel, you speak my name 
 The needle turns, the hourglass is spinning around 
 Give it, I want it... a sense of a fucking life 
 I can almost feel mine at home 
 Selfish cries 
 I am diseased 
 Let it pour out and show what has healed 
 One can finally find what's left inside this masochistic personality 
 In a holy bond we live 
 Take a breath for seconds in this moment 
 Sail upon the open skies 
 Exhale your death and feel life, like water raining from above 
 Majestic aura 
 Take in my breath and lock eyes with a world once absent of your love 
 Majestic aura 
 Blood is spent 
 A token for my sacrifice 
 The tortured realm has released my name 
 I can feel my body parting with this world 
 Rebirth is starting from within 
 I'm born some place, beyond your time 
 Selfish cries 
 Flaunt disease 
 Own what's mine 
 Death upon my knees 
 Let it pour out and show what has healed 
 One can finally find what's left inside this masochistic personality 
 In a holy bond we live 
 Take a breath for seconds in this moment 
 Sail upon the open skies 
 Floating up above the hadean seal 
 Sounds of ambient voices will lead me from nowhere 
 This skeletal mask brings a demon of the day
########### The Price Is Wrong ###########
Knock me out and put a stone on my head 
 Or throw me on the tracks where the steel can kill me quick 
 The sound of emergency is stapling a fright upon their ears 
 I'm feeling surrounded 
 I'm feeling the slap of one thousand shit-brains 
 Behold, my dark intentions rising from below 
 Beauty 
 Disgusting blood 
 Fatal wounds of the last emotion 
 All will pay the price 
 Now is the time that we separate our realities 
 Stopping a heart that beats inside the meddling 
 Correcting moments lost by living in the here and now 
 You're on the fucking block 
 Tell me any way I can relate now before the generation dies 
 Time keeps moving faster and faster, 
 And I can take the full step in killing the generation 
 Beauty 
 Disgusting blood 
 Fatal wounds of the last emotion 
 All will pay the price 
 Get off the fucking building 
 I'll send 'em sinking into the fires of fate 
 Every word is like a shotgun shell so burn inside my hell 
 I'll drown before the fucking ship hits the ocean floor and thank God 
 I'm not alive to see the slack-jawed generation spread its fucking seed 
 Tell me any way I can relate now before the generation dies 
 Time keeps moving faster and faster, and 
 I can take the full step in killing the generation 
 Beauty 
 Disgusting blood 
 Fatal wounds of the last emotion 
 All will pay the price 
 Pouring sludge into the mouth 
 They feed and I can't stand the stench of it 
 I didn't see the first and I sure won't see the last 
 But something has gotta give 
 Pouring sludge into the mouth 
 They feed and I can't stand the stench of it 
 I didn't see the first and I sure won't see the last 
 It would put a smile on my face just to take that breath away 
 Beauty 
 Disgusting blood 
 Fatal wounds of the last emotion 
 All will pay the price

Tell me, mannequin what brings you to move? 
 Is it all of the colors in the magazine? 
 Following sucks 
 Paint your face now pose and filter the mood 
 Give it all you've got 
 You're just a click away from the fame now 
 Eat shit, motormouth 
 Swallow all of it down 
 You're pretty when you put the face on 
 And when you shut that mouth 
 Those chattering teeth lose my sympathy 
 Got a lot to say? 
 You've gotta leave it out of the game you play 
 You've gotta leave it out of the game you play 
 Nothing you say holds any value 
 It weaves through the ears like a worm 
 Searching for light of the masses

 Tell me 
 You've gotta leave it out of the game you play 
 Only a conscience can stop me from beating you in 
 Not on the side of the fuck-stain you leave on the earth 
 I may not be the force constricting sin 
 But you defile this planet 
 There's shit in your grin 
 No way I can end this screaming alone 
 No way we can stop this unless we choose to grow 
 What will they find, digging around in that oh so empty mind? 
 What will they find, digging around in that oh so empty mind?
########### Marigold ###########
Flash through this life like a death grip, we're satisfied 
 It's the mundane I'm keeping out of sight, but still we are young 
 We are young 
 I'll steer the angels down 
 Keep 'em in the back room, shut the door, let go 
 And now he's there at the grey, gold dead bed of lies 
 Pushing daisies while we still feel the sunshine 
 We are young 
 We are young 
 Sift through the marigolds to please our damaged souls 
 This place is holding me 
 Jump through the rope let's make it credible 
 When blood is all we see 
 Life is impossible 
 Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling 
 We're on the clock and the needle's turning 
 The misery's killing me slowly 
 Give me a spark to work it out 
 You're just another one wandering endlessly on to the grave 
 The signs of the times are upon us 
 So we're grieving for tommorow 
 Sucking on the mother's dead tit 
 I'm so low 
 So low 
 It's all right 
 We learn it all before we go 
 Snapped by the neck as we swallow 
 Chin up 
 I'm tying the rope 
 Leaving all hollow 
 This place is holding me 
 Jump through the rope let's make it credible 
 When blood is all we see 
 Life is impossible 
 Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling 
 We're on the clock and the needle's turning fast 
 The misery's killing me slowly 
 Give me a spark to work it out 
 No funeral, no pyre that's burning 
 This body's dust in the wind that's hurling past 
 The misery's killing me slowly 
 Give me a spark to work it out 
 I guess I will just leave things the way they are 
 This place is holding me (this place is holding me) 
 Jump through the rope let's make it credible (credible) 
 When blood is all we see 
 Life is impossible 
 Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling 
 We're on the clock and the needle's turning 
 The misery's killing me slowly 
 Give me a spark to work it out 
 Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling 
 We're on the clock and the needle's turning fast 
 The misery's killing me slowly 
 Give me a spark to work it out 
 No funeral, no pyre that's burning

Wake up 
 As I stumble into a blinding light 
 Deeper breaths enough to kill the highest highs 
 Take one good look and I'm at the lowest low again 
 Down at the bottom, but I'm fine 
 Tears march to lullabies and beat me like a drum 
 Oh no 
 It's not your average fucking misery 
 This heart has chords, but not single one sounds new or fun 
 Hit strings in dissonance 
 Pick on and on and on 
 Show them how to fly away when this world is torn 
 If you feel like dying, lose that forever 
 You're shining and it shows 
 You're shining and it shows 
 Living through the highest highs

 Down at the bottom, but I'm fine 
 I try to feed it, but it still wants more 
 Give me that feeling that I'm looking for 
 Show them how to fly away when this world is torn 
 If you feel like dying, lose that forever 
 We're shining and it shows 
 Wake up 
 As I stumble into a blinding light 
 Deeper breaths enough to kill the highest highs

 Living in a state of mind controlled by a tyrant 
 Mistakes burn 
 Never did he learn to back off and spit that shit 
 I'm that motherfucker picking in your old brain and stealing sleep 
 Take the dive or keep it alive? 
 Now it's on you 
 Your tower is falling down into a black hole 
 Take it away

 The agony is crumbling over your soul 
 Take it away

 Lost in the violent throes of this separation 
 Done waiting on pleasant times 
 Never arrived

########### Flatline ###########
All rise! 
 Judged like a jury but in a trial. 
 No respect for the young and innocent. 
 Guilty! 
 Now shut the doors and then open fire. 
 So fail to make the connection and lose beauty in the mouth of rejection. 
 Can't we understand that no life is out of our hands? 
 Suffocation and the fear of living setting in so let go. 
 Let go before he lets go. 
 Patience is wearing thin and leaving him so let go. 
 Let go before he lets go of this life. 
 I wonder what goes on? 
 Before he lets go he says. 
 Send an angel to pull me from the hell below. 
 This weight is far too much to hold. 
 And this body doesn't feel like home. 
 Send an angel, I feel I'm dying all alone. 
 So lift me up or let me go. 
 'Cause this body doesn't feel like home. 
 No! 
 This body doesn't feel like home. 
 No! 
 Love feels far away. 
 The lack of motivation keeps the soul from bettering, it's no life. 
 Now reach the next level with a bottle and a blade. 
 Retreating it is no way. 
 Suffocation and the fear of living setting in, so let go. 
 Let go before he lets go. 
 Patience is wearing thin and leaving him, so let go. 
 Let go before he lets go of this life. 
 I wonder what goes on behind those bloodshot eyes? 
 I wonder what goes on? 
 Before he lets go he says. 
 Send an angel to pull me from the hell below. 
 This weight is far too much to hold. 
 And this body doesn't feel like home. 
 Send an angel, I feel I'm dying all alone. 
 So lift me up or let me go. 
 'Cause this body doesn't feel like home. 
 Sleep now and carry on into the black of the night. 
 Sleep now and you'll be on your way. 
 There's another one moving on from the flatline, flatline. 
 Sleep now and carry on into the black of the night. 
 Sleep now and you'll be on your way. 
 There's another one moving on from the flatline, flatline. 
 Slip into the fray. 
 Slip between the night and day.

 Head greaves with everything but does it make it right?

Reputations made 
 I failed to save 
 The cold I seek is all I'll feel 
 Today I'm selling mine after all 
 Watch it all fade away to gray 
 I sold it to rule the world 
 If only I could rescue you 
 Cleaning up the mess we've made 
 It's not the same without your love 
 Do you care at all? 
 I don't see a difference 
 Is this love at all? 
 We stayed so close in this life at one time 
 Now I watch as you fade away 
 Behind the wall of hate inside your mind 
 Will we meet again? 
 I'll be waiting beyond the edge 
 Forever frozen 
 Now time stops again 
 Revelation 
 I've found that it's all gone 
 The absence within us grows 
 Illuminate the way we choose to flow 
 Do you care at all? 
 I don't see a difference 
 Is this a love at all? 
 I hold one last feeling of hope 
 Our paths will meet again 
 Beyond the edge 
 Forever frozen 
 Time stops now
########### Catch Fire ###########
Lock eyes like we're staring down the barrel of a shotgun 
 Appear so quickly 
 Leave as swiftly as you came 
 Sometimes I wish I had the measure of a wise man 
 But I set the mood, plant the tomb and bury all the bones within 
 It sure is something when we all catch fire 
 Bodies burning like the sunrise 
 Stay with me, I'll show you paradise 
 It feels so right 
 Give me that peace of mind and I'll give you everything 
 Just know it feels so good that I could die and be alright 
 Alive 
 We breathe when everthing is as it seems 
 But is there something much more? 
 Underneath the sheets, beneath the skin 
 There's a beauty waiting to be adored 
 We're cradled in the thick of it, but too ignorant to give a shit 
 We set the mood, we plant the tomb and bury all the bones within 
 Don't keep me hanging from the mouth 
 It sure is something when we all catch fire 
 Bodies burning like the sunrise 
 Stay with me, I'll show you paradise 
 It feels so right 
 Give me that peace of mind and I'll give you everything 
 Just know it feels so good that I could die and join the stars 
 Give me that peace of mind and I'll give you everything 
 Stay with me, I'll show you paradise 
 It feels so right 
 We exsist in this moment only to fly 
 Just stay with me 
 Twisting love as we hold it on the inside 
 Just stay with me 
 It sure is something when we all catch fire 
 Bodies burning like the sunrise 
 Stay with me, I'll show you paradise 
 It feels so right 
 Give me that peace of mind and I'll give you everything 
 Just know it feels so good that I could die and join the stars 
 Give me that peace of mind and I'll give you everything 
 Stay with me, I'll show you paradise 
 It feels so right!
########### Prayer Position ###########
Another day pulls me down to my knees and 
 Hold the gun to my fucking head 
 Can't feel a thing 
 Prayer position holding my life above the muck 
 Oh god, I'm speaking in swirling bowls 
 Now the walls are laughing in silence 
 I'm spiraling down to the floor 
 Can't feel a thing 
 (missing text sponcor halp pls) 
 When will it end? 
 When is it over? 
 When can I live? 
 The bar is held down on my throat 
 Kicking and screaming, I live this life down in a hole 
 Take away misery tomorrow 
 Shine the light and end this dimming glow 
 Take away misery tomorrow 
 Shine the light to end this dimming glow 
 The day is gone 
 Now turns the night 
 Our bodies glow ever so bright 
 The crash is done 
 We reach new highs 
 Our bodies glow ever so bright 
 Ventur through these eyes 
 Ventur through these eyes and lose all time 
 Scratch the itch and murder the body for pleasure 
 Sparking it up 
 Breathing the fire we crave 
 Guzzle it down 
 Feeling the sparkle together 
 Ante it up and blow me away for the high 
 Let's go 
 What are we doing and where have the morals all gone? 
 Now is the time 
 This is the feeling we treasure 
 You won't remember, but godamnit it's fine 
 The bar is held down on my throat 
 Kicking and screaming, I live this life down in a hole 
 Take away misery tomorrow 
 Shine the light and end this dimming glow 
 Take away misery tomorrow 
 Shine the light to end this dimming glow 
 Stomp my head, throw it down in a hole 
 Stomp on my heart 
 Let's go

Snow coming down now 
 Like December, burning up in the summer rays 
 But I'm not stumbling, like a pretender 
 Medicine flowing through my veins 
 Heavy eyes like a tongue won't stutter 
 Mouths are moving, and this heart's still fluttering 
 I'm on my own! 
 You found me at the core now 
 I am wrapped within the warmth of your touch 
 There's never a moment that I let slip by in your eyes 
 Are we growing old day and day? 
 Am I melting in the rays of this love? 
 Never ever gonna let you go 
 Don't let go 
 Never gonna let you go 
 Slow it down, now 
 I cannot remember why I let them chew on my brain 
 They've and left this town 
 In smoldering embers, 
 But my gift will dye in your eye 
 Heavy eyes like a tongue won't stutter 
 Mouths are moving, and this heart's still fluttering 
 I'm on my own! 
 You found me at the core now 
 I am wrapped within the warmth of your touch 
 There's never a moment that I let slip by in your eyes 
 Are we growing old day and day? 
 Am I melting in the rays of this love? 
 Never ever gonna let you go 
 Don't let go! 
 Do you feel the love? 
 Yes I feel the love 
 Chase it, hold it, feel it, never let it go 
 Do you feel the love? 
 Yes I feel the love 
 Do you feel the love? 
 Yes I feel the love 
 Chase it, hold it, feel it, never let it go! 
 Never let it go! 
 Don't let go! 
 Don't let go!
########### Pala Aura ###########
Walking through water as it dampens our feet 
 Watch as we call in self-defeat 
 The trees are calling to the man in the mask 
 They know his true identity, identity 
 Come and stare 
 Come and stare at her love through these eyes 
 From a mountain so high 
 Is it possible we've forsaken our Mother? 
 Return to nowhere 
 And nature will know my name 
 This is what it takes to feel at home 
 In her soul that's beyond light is where I lay (I lay) 
 Until the dusk of man 
 Yes he squanders the life he leads 
 Still the end will call 
 Birth of anti-bionic seed 
 Will he grow with fault? 
 Grow with fault 
 Come and stare 
 Come and stare at her love through these eyes 
 From a mountain so high 
 Is it possible we've forsaken our Mother? 
 Return to nowhere 
 And nature will know my name 
 This is what it takes to feel at home 
 In her soul that's beyond light is where I lay (I lay) 
 Until the dusk. OF. MAN! 
 [4x] 
 When it snows 
 Do you feel the love? 
 Wind, it blows 
 Through our bodies 
 Return to what we know

AND SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH THOSE INNOCENT EYES, EYES AS INNOCENT AS A CHILD PORN ACTRESS OR SOME SHIT, AND SHE SAID THE NAME OF SOME FUCKING PERFUME BY SOME FRENCH GUY AND SHE COULDN'T EVEN PRONOUNCE IT RIGHT, SO I WENT OVER TO THE FREAKING PERFUME SHOP AND I WALKED IN AND THE SMELL, IT JUST FUCKING OVERPOWERED ME FROM MY ALREADY CHAPPED NOSE, IT WAS SO COLD AND ON TOP OF THAT I WAS SMELLING THE FUCKING CHRISTMAS TREE ALL THE WAY ON THE RIDE HOME, AND I ASKED HER, I WAS LIKE 'DO YOU HAVE THIS PERFUME BY THIS FRENCH GUY? I THINK HE'S GAY OR SOME SHIT' AND SHE WAS LIKE 'OH YES, YES WE HAVE THAT RIGHT OVER HERE' I WAS LIKE 'YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME, IT'S LIKE FRENCH AND GAY AND YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT I WANT' AND SHE HANDED IT TO ME AND I BOUGHT IT, IT WAS LIKE, A HUNDRED AND FUCKING EIGHTY DOLLARS OR SOME SHIT, BUT I GOT IT BECAUSE I LOVE MY GIRLFRIEND. AND THEN I WENT HOME AND I WRAPPED IT AND I PUT IT UNDERNEATH THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND MY GIRLFRIEND CAME TO ME AND SHE WAS LIKE 'BABY, LET'S GO TO MIDNIGHT MASS' IT'S LIKE 'HONEY, COME ON MAN, I'M SORRY, I DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING THAT CRAZY SHIT' BUT IT WAS THE CHRISTMAS SEASON SO I WENT, AND WE WENT THERE AND I WAS FALLING ASLEEP IN CHURCH SO I FELT BAD, SO I HAD SOME COFFEE.

AND HE SAID: 
 "Hello, I'm going to sing you a song" 
 Dashing through the snow 
 On a one horse open sleigh 
 Over the fields we go 
 Laughing all the way h0h0h0 
 Bells on bob tails ring 
 Making spirits bright 
 Please sir, my mom's on crack and she'll beat my ass if I don't make money tonight! 
 MAN YOU'VE GOT TOURETTE'S OR SOMETHING, THAT'S WHY I CLOSED THE DOOR, GET A FUCKING CLUE, STOP SINGING, STOP SINGING. OH YEAH YEAH, WALK AWAY, WALK AWAY, SING TO YOURSELF, WALK AWAY, OKAY THAT'S GOOD, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

AND I WAS LIKE 'LOOK BITCH, SHUT THE FUCK UUUUUUUP!!!' AND ALL OF A SUDDEN LIKE YOUR MOM JUST STARTED FREAKING OUT, LIKE SOMEONE CALLED HER A BITCH ONE TOO MANY TIMES IN THE PAST, I MEAN LIKE REALLY CRIED HER EYES OUT! AND IT'S SO FUCKED UP CAUSE LIKE, I THOUGHT THEY HAD IT TOGETHER BUT THEN YOUR DAD CAME UP AND TRIED TO PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER AND SHE'S LIKE 'GET AWAY FROM ME YOU BABY KILLER!' NOW IT'S JUST A WHOLE BUNCH OF PROBLEMS THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN TO SO I FOCUSED BACK ON MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WAS LIKE 'MAN LOOK! YOU HAVEN'T EVEN ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS! BUT IT'S OK, I MEAN THERE'S LIKE A GIFT UNDERNEATH THE TREE, BUT I PROBABLY DON'T WANT IT, HOW COULD YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT? YOU NEVER EVEN ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED, BUT THAT'S OK BABY, CAUSE I KNOW WHAT I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS. I WANT YOU THE FUCK OUT OF MY LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFE! 
 DRUMMER: "Yeah man, that's some crazy shit, but anyway, check out what I got for Christmas. A new set of drums, man. This is going to be the shit."

########### One ###########
I can't remember anything 
 Can't tell if this is true or dream 
 Deep down inside I feel the scream 
 This terrible silence stops with me 
 Now that the war is through with me 
 I'm waking up, I cannot see 
 That there's not much left of me 
 Nothing is real but pain now 
 Hold my breath as I wish for death 
 Oh please God, wake me 
 Back in the womb it's much too real 
 In pumps life that I must feel 
 But can't look forward to reveal 
 Look to the time when I'll live 
 Fed through the tube that sticks in me 
 Just like a wartime novelty 
 Tied to machines that make me be 
 Cut this life off from me 
 Hold my breath as I wish for death 
 Oh please God, wake me 
 Now the world is gone I'm just one 
 Oh God help me 
 Hold my breath as I wish for death 
 Oh please God, help me 
 Darkness 
 Imprisoning me 
 All that I see 
 Absolute horror 
 I cannot live 
 I cannot die 
 Trapped in myself 
 Body my holding cell 
 Landmine has taken my sight 
 Taken my speech 
 Taken my hearing 
 Taken my arms 
 Taken my legs 
 Taken my soul 
 Left me with life in hell

The blindness of his spirit led his feet towards the unknown 
 And those who fell in the past are here to take over his soul 
 Yet he fails 
 He fails to recognize the light 
 We are in the presence of innefable energy 
 That could bring his soul back to life x2 
 The choice is in your hands, it will bring you back to life x2 
 Let it blossom and shine away, illuminate your biggest fears and simply walk away x2 
 Yet he allows it to slip through his fingers 
 Those trembling hands 
 Wake up and make the last step 
 The last step towards the end

We are 
 We are dead to the world 
 And we are dead to the world 
 We're sealed away from 
 From those wandering eyes (from those wandering eyes) 
 From those wandering eyes 
 And everything around us 
 Everything around us seemes to stir 
 We gazed at the pale grey lustrous ocean 
 As it fades away. 
 As it washes away, washes away all our dreams. 
 As it washes, away. 
 And one and only, single fractured idea 
 Managed to make its way, to the end of it all. 
 So contagious but yet so flawless, 
 Just try, just try to stop us now, 
 Just try to stop us now.

 Counterfeit parts of the earth 
 Find their way into the depths of creation

 Concealed in the layers 
 Hidden from ordinary eyes

(feat. Garrison Lee - Erra) 
 The age of man is at it's end time 
 Progress for progress sake won't keep us all alive 
 Soon we shall the the errors of our ways 
 Everything that ends begins the same 
 In a world that's bound to break 
 (Garrison Lee:) 
 Look deep into yourself and realize that your soul is withering 
 In this hell in this distraction that keeps us from prospering 
 Find the light that is hidden away within 
 In due time break the foundations and build them up again 
 Look through the portal 
 Histories secrets are in reach 
 Reclaim the memories of our fathers 
 Seek perfection from lives once lost 
 Illuminate the path that lies before us 
 Look inside 
 We've been asleep for too long 
 It's time to wakeup now 
 We've been asleep for too long 
 It's time to wakeup now 
 In a world covered by darkness 
 I look out as far as my eyes can see 
 Searching for what we are destined to become 
 Darkness will covet the light (2x) 
 We've been asleep for too long 
 It's time to wakeup now 
 We've been asleep for too 
 Long it's time to wakeup now (2x)

 Where do we go from here 
 As the world begins to crumble 
 Crumble away in front of our eyes 
 In this place that we find ourselves 
 There is no way to be sure of anything 
 As the world begins to crumble 
 Crumble away in front of our eyes 
 In this place that we find ourselves 
 There is no way to be sure of anything

 In this place that we find ourselves 
 We're drifting away 
 From the truth that we find when we search inside 
 (if you can feel me 
 If you know i'm right here beside you 
 Breathe in and don't let go) 
 We were once connected 
 Connected from worlds apart 
 We were once symmetric 
 My inverse counterpart 
 Between you and i 
 There is something that is missing 
 I can feel my grasp slipping away 
 There is nothing

Oh off now 
 The call sounds near 
 Danger comes now, they won't find us here. 
 In scorn they will burn! 
 ...Once again it repeats 
 For thousands of years 
 Rain has shrouded our fears. 
 Pawns disregard the ebb and flow 
 Overcrowded the stage has become 
 The human condition begs for more and mercy. 
 Oh will you find a place within the vale? 
 Will you drift in discordant breeze? 
 The native soul will be lost in time 
 Our stage of bedlam forlorned. 
 Blackness, darkness afar 
 In plumes they posture 
 With forboding nature 
 They claw at the sun. 
 We wait for the end. 
 Reform 
 The heart now stands clear 
 Danger comes now, they won't harm us here. 
 The event of roaring decimation 
 Will swallow the earth and bring it to it's knees 
 The oil in the mud is boiling the blood of our sanctuary 
 These demons of iron will surely pay! 
 Stirring forth 
 Reclaim the land 
 From seeds sown 
 Gaia climbs again! 
 Frustration grows up 
 'Til we meet the sky 
 Away from here. 
 Fel winds bring 
 Self-immolation 
 They will fail to find their abode. 
 We wait for the end 
 We wait for the end of days 
 To come and save us all 
 We are the ones who need it most 
 To fix our minds on the unknown.
########### Glass Faces ###########
All my dreams 
 Are wavering right in front of me 
 Avoiding light 
 Deception aside, my dreams will come alive. 
 They've come to terrorize and take away what once was mine 
 Watching in awe with empty eyes 
 Until I wake, my mind breaks, suffering withdrawal from the sublime. 
 Making laughter, can't remember 
 How we spent our time together. 
 Tell me my friend 
 What can you see? 
 What comes into your mind as you breathe? 
 Cause I see colors flourishing 
 Like you'd never believe 
 Like a pendulum swings 
 They swing with me. 
 Breathe, just try to breathe 
 Think, try to think the reasons for anything 
 Believe, believe something beyond what you see 
 Chaos, be free, let it be what it wants you to be. 
 Could you ever 
 Express your life in a phrase 
 Tell me my friend 
 What would it say? 
 That you lived your life and waited out your days? 
 Well you can take that to your grave. 
 So, tell me my friend 
 What can you see? 
 What comes into your mind as you breathe? 
 Cause I see colors flourishing 
 Like you'd never believe

 Breathe, just try to breathe. 
 Think, try to think the reasons for anything. 
 Making laughter, can't remember 
 All this time we've spent our days 
 Keeping to ourselves. 
 Could you ever express your life in a phrase? 
 Can you find the words, what would they say? 
 That you loved and lost and waited out your days? 
 Well you can take that to your grave.
########### The Sound Of Glaciers Moving ###########
Leave, leave me here 
 For the grievous faults 
 That have fractured my past 
 I would do the same for you. 
 (We wouldn't want you) 
 I was to be a legend 
 (To be a victim in it's stead) 
 But now I am a victim in it's stead 
 I hear the titans mocking me 
 Waiting in desperation. 
 Stars are gazing on 
 Dishonest confessions 
 Sailing the seas of nostalgia's 
 Revery to send 
 My donations to the cosmos afar. 
 I could not have known 
 I would end up down here 
 So alone, can't stay here any longer 
 I know. 
 Can't you see it in the dark? 
 I've grown so cold. 
 And as the stars are gazing on 
 Dishonest confessions 
 Sailing the seas of nostalgia's 
 Revery to send 
 My donations to the cosmos afar. 
 These nothing years haunt me 
 Like vacant seats at my last requiem 
 I'm a mortal now 
 On a wild ship heaving 
 I close my eyes one last time 
 So far misunderstood.
########### Aviation ###########
Wings are now a part of me 
 (I'm) disappearing straight 
 Into the night alone I'll make my journey. 
 In this life an endless solo flight 
 Bow thy head and close thy peasant mind. 
 Now comes the deafening roar 
 Followed by an eternal calm 
 Silence! silence, the sound of emptiness 
 The absence of your moaning virgin whore. 
 Sky falls down like a fountain 
 Washing over me with calming void 
 If this peace is called loneliness 
 We were truly meant to stand alone 
 Meant to stand alone. 
 Blue overhead, since the dawn of man 
 Heavens follow, wherever we roam 
 Blue turns black, heavens retreat 
 Losing a faith in between. 
 What is set in stone, when stone no longer paves your road 
 When paths are no longer guided by earthly tomes 
 You too can soar.
########### Red Sky Harbor ###########
A pale grey 
 Is over head 
 I'm dragging feet 
 In the sand 
 It grows inside 
 To return instead 
 And still I'll take 
 My chances 
 Here alone. 
 As the sun surely rises I will toil beneath the waves 
 The scent of sea air lingers in my lungs at the end of the day. 
 This is my dominion 
 Through clear water I can see 
 All the past I've been here 
 Wading through forests of plant-like monstrosities. 
 To think I would ever find such riches 
 Beneath the oceans wide 
 Sinking down 
 To the 
 Depths of my demise 
 As the seas turn dark and frightening. 
 Immersed I've been in self-righteous findings 
 I fade in lieu of reflecting within. 
 High on martian life 
 My body begs for rest in this cavern's peaceful eye 
 Impending death before me, I'll catch 
 My breath before I leave 
 Somehow I'll press on in spite. 
 It's a vast ocean that I am becoming 
 I fade in lieu of reflecting within. 
 All 
 I am 
 Is this me? 
 This shard of earth 
 Cast from within 
 The darkened sea. 
 Risen 
 At last 
 To drink 
 The warmth of the sun 
 Is free. 
 I'm not tired 
 I'm not afraid, I know 
 I'll stay here for a while 
 I'm not tired 
 I'm not afraid, I know 
 I'll stay here for a while.
########### Blood Petals ###########
Sound the siren, the storm has come 
 Searching for answers posing no significance 
 To the self 
 The ritual has run it's malignant fucking course. 
 Forsaken to the core 
 By the constant cut-throat game of lust 
 Stow into the underworld 
 Your pain endowed. 
 Feast on silence 
 Until the island sinks 
 Til' the ghosts at bay 
 Swim the sweet song of revenge 
 Right down to your soul 
 Passion flows with revenge. 
 Her glowing eyes 
 Speak to him 
 Temptation he can't resist 
 (He waits for her in suspense). 
 Tonight the meadows stir with strife. 
 The dream is over, it's not your fault 
 You toil in these thoughts so willingly 
 The dream is over, it's not your fault 
 I'm wide awake without you. 
 Promise me you won't be so disarming 
 Oh, how intent 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 I would rather be safe than sorry 
 It's a crying shame that you have turned out insane. 
 The dream is over, it's not your fault 
 You toil in these thoughts so willingly 
 The dream is over, it's not your fault 
 I'm wide awake without you. 
 Baby tell me a story... 
 One I haven't heard 
 Before I end this tale of a spiteful man 
 Cause' I'll hide inside my mind 
 If it'll take you to the end 
 Cause' I'm caught intoxicated 
 With the sweet liquor of revenge. 
 How could you love as I once had 
 When all was true in the moment 
 For love is just a word to you 
 A tool to lose an opponent, yeah! 
 He's got her weak singing blood is in the air 
 Oh, it's in her bloody stair 
 Yeah, he's got her singing blood is in the air, tonight 
 Blood is in the air. x2

########### Unlike Us ###########
It's a blitz when they're hearing us 
 A riff so serious 
 In a total eclipse 
 Am I clear enough 
 Vocals skipping to the kick drums 
 Kick back with a six pack and a big Bud 
 Do shows and we get love 
 Even though there is friction 
 Some don't wanna listen 
 There's a hole in the system 
 Try get to grips 
 I'll catch your fist and snap your wrist 
 Music is dope in my veins 
 Can you handle this? 
 So sick I need psycho-analysis 
 I'm an anarchist 
 Far from a pacifist 
 We rep Hacktivist, influential 
 With tunes so powerful 
 Set the beginning of change! 
 Set the beginning of change! 
 It's a blitz when they're hearing us 
 Fights break out because of us 
 Chaos we're tearing up 
 We're down to the next show and it's kicking off 
 Can't get more real than this 
 Aim high like the pyramids 
 I'm a badboy lyricist 
 Grooves so tight are you feeling this 
 Haters step back 'coz you're taking the piss 
 Ain't got no time for your shit 
 We cause a commotion 
 We're smashing the scene 
 We're drawing in closer 
 The crowds will follow us 
 Sick of the mundane 
 Hacktivist, influential 
 With tunes so powerful 
 Set the beginning of change! 
 Set the beginning of change!
########### Cold Shoulders ###########
There's a shining at the skyline and its twisting 
 manifesting into something big 
 you can try to hide but it won't do a thing 
 next level more than anything seen 
 we take over your days over 
 two blades on my cold shoulders 
 contagious like a Trojan you're frozen ice age 
 these days are far from golden 
 Volcanoes erupt from beneath 
 as we stand here gritting our teeth 
 a thousand years go by in a week 
 as we lose the world to this piece by piece 
 as thunder rips through the seams 
 like a lightening strike 
 you can never break free can't leave 
 like a government scheme 
 your sucked in locked in 
 without no key 
 They ain't got no patience 
 bodies get left with bare lacerations 
 you don't wanna see their retaliation 
 no explanation they start an invasion 
 They've been incarcerated sedated 
 their pupils dilated most hated 
 for making you open your mind 
 to what we've designed 
 As nations divide 
 you can't test what's happening 
 its more real than its ever been 
 I'm looking from the other side 
 Times are hard as nations divide 
 gotta choose a path 
 hold on hurricanes and shooting stars 
 hope mother earth takes me with open arms 
 I'm looking from the other side 
 I'm nothing but an outcast 
 hear the sounds from the blast 
 catastrophic turn the amp up a couple notches 
 put your hands up if you got this 
 As nations divide 
 you can't test what's happening 
 its more real than its ever been 
 I'm looking from the other side 
 this poison's destiny 
 the one thing that was meant to be 
 There's a shining at the skyline and its twisting 
 manifesting into something big 
 you can try to hide but it won't do a thing 
 next level more than anything seen 
 we take over your days over 
 two blades on my cold shoulders 
 contagious like a Trojan you're frozen ice age 
 these days are far from golden 
 As nations divide 
 you can't test what's happening 
 its more real than its ever been 
 I'm looking from the other side 
 this poison's destiny 
 the one thing that was meant to be 
 Walk this line 
 So far from a day dream 
 how can I choose when I can't see 
 you will never out last me 
 I'm on top of this don't put it past me 
 lets wake to reality
########### Our Time ###########
If you're listening to this album, we thank you 
 You've opened up to the notion that you don't need to follow 
 You've steered away from the masses 
 That swallow anything that's presented in front of them 
 If you're digging our tunes or just here to criticize 
 Either way, you've given us your time 
 We've carved out a H in the corner of your mind 
 We are the leaders; we never fall in line 
 Point out all the mistakes humanity has made 
 You'll be left with a dead arm for days and days 
 But now it's our time, it's never felt so right 
 The future is ours; we stand; we fight 
 Try to push aside; we hit back harder 
 We all deserve a place in this world and the life after 
 Ascension is inevitable like each day's dawn 
 Do not obey, do not conform 
 An easy life is boring 
 Come with us and ride the storm 
 Religion, race hate and country borders 
 Were created to eliminate the truth before us 
 Fear and separation are tools that distort us 
 So we bring it back with a verse and a chorus 
 Looking out on all like the eye of Horus
########### Hate ###########
You must think that we're slipping off a roof 
 By the way we get slated down 
 Can't stop us spitting on a riddim in the booth 
 Changing the game and sound 
 Had an idea sitting in my room 
 Now we're playing to a bouncing crowd 
 Hit 'em with sixteen bars and hooks 
 We will never throw in the towel 
 Now we got the whole scene shook 
 Middle finger just won't go down 
 Grime kid in the metal scene getting funny looks 
 Screw up your face and frown 
 A million views on a tune is proof 
 That we've produced our own style 
 We've come a long way from our hometown 
 With the world on our shoulders, we'll never back down 
 Why you wanna hate on us? 
 Why you wanna hate on us? 
 No lies, we're givin' 'em the truth 
 They were leavin' the pit, less teeth in their mouth 
 On a mic wire swinging from the roof 
 We crowd surf and get deep with the fans 
 We don't get sick of the abuse 
 We get booked for a show in Amsterdam 
 Who's billin' up? Pass me the blues 
 Blowing negativity out the window, fam 
 I can't believe what we've done in four years 
 And all we're gonna do is expand 
 Try something new 'cause we got no fears 
 Live shows getting five K's in Kerrang! 
 Turned a hobby into a career 
 Now we travel across the globe with one plan 
 Still you wanna hate on us? 
 Nah, the whole scene's in the palm of our hand 
 Why you wanna hate on me 
 Or talk like you don't rate my team? 
 You ain't even bringing no riffs to the scene 
 We be doing this till we're living our dream 
 Why you wanna hate on me 
 Or talk like you don't rate my team? 
 You ain't even bringing no heat to the scene 
 And the real mans know that we're dope on the streets 
 Yeah, the real mans know that we're dope on the streets 
 Who would've thought that four years back 
 We'd spawn from the scene and attack? 
 Sound alike bands are whack 
 Need H in your mind like a fiend needs crack 
 Who would've thought that four years back 
 We'd spawn from the scene and attack? 
 Sound alike bands are whack 
 Now we're tight in the game, won't fall back 
 Who would've thought that four years back 
 We'd spawn from the scene and attack? 
 Sound alike bands are whack 
 Need H in your mind like a fiend needs crack 
 Who would've thought that four years back 
 We'd spawn from the scene and attack? 
 Sound alike bands are whack 
 Now we're tight in the game, won't fall back 
 Why you wanna hate on me 
 Or talk like you don't rate my team? 
 You ain't even bringing no riffs to the scene 
 We be doing this till we're living our dream 
 Why you wanna hate on me 
 Or talk like you don't rate my team? 
 You ain't even bringing no heat to the scene 
 And the real mans know that we're dope on the streets
########### Deceive And Defy ###########
Music resonates, my eyes dilate 
 And it triggers off parts of my brain 
 I get a feeling that I can't explain 
 The pen is a receiver, my heart spills on a page 
 From a very young age, didn't really care about wage 
 We make the hairs at the back of your neck stand up 
 With CD or with passion on stage 
 We are the new sound wave 
 Maintain balance in the music game 
 These wise words I'mma take to my grave 
 I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for just 
 Naturally jammin' with mates 
 Now everybody wanna go on X Factor 'cause they wanna be famous 
 But the H is infamous and we don't wanna be famous 
 We wanna make changes 
 This life, one shot, one dream 
 This life, one way to succeed 
 This life, one shot, one dream 
 They deceive and defy on big screens 
 Subliminal thoughts as I spit syllables on a chord 
 At my own accord, the chemicals in my brain explode 
 Another rhythm pattern and I start goin' on raw 
 And they ain't never seen talent in Britain like this before 
 A sixteen on a riff is a rift we cause 
 These finalists don't get no applause 
 They just wanna go number one 
 Another year yet another cunt 
 And now we're here for the long run 
 We tell the judge we don't give a fuck 
 We got fire in our blood, too many young minds corrupt 
 Dragged down thinking they're on their way up 
 This game is tough, gotta stay strong to survive on the throne 
 This life, one shot, one dream 
 This life, one way to succeed 
 This life, one shot, one dream 
 They deceive and defy on big screens 
 This life, one shot, one dream 
 (One dream) 
 This life, one way to succeed 
 (One way) 
 This life, one shot, one dream 
 (One dream) 
 They deceive and defy on big screens 
 Where, where will you go? 
 Spotlights don't shine on graves just so you know 
 Leave a legacy, spirit lives on 
 Leave this with me; I will prove you all wrong 
 Where, where will you go? 
 Where will you go? 
 This life, one shot, one dream 
 This life, one way to succeed 
 This life, one shot, one dream 
 They deceive and defy on big screens 
 This life, one shot, one dream 
 (One dream) 
 This life, one way to succeed 
 (One way) 
 This life, one shot, one dream 
 They deceive and defy on big screens 
 Fuck
########### Taken ###########
Before your time's up 
 These bars will open your mind up 
 The spirit inside ya will live on till time's done 
 But when the lights go out you might not rise up 
 Again like the sun, so embrace the present 
 You never know when you might lose somebody you love 
 Grievance hasn't got a button you can just turn off 
 Gotta stay true to yourself at any cost 
 Ascend to the sky, you won't get lost 
 When a loved one's here for a second then gone 
 Your heart beats to the sound of the drum 
 When someone above's still sending you signals 
 Letting you know you're not on your own 
 Hold onto your people 'cause we were born alone, we won't die alone 
 You will never lose face by offering a shoulder 
 Bring them into your space when the world seems like it's colder 
 You will never lose face by offering a shoulder 
 Bring them into your space 
 I've got love for friends and family who have fallen 
 Regardless of distance I know none of us here wanna be forgotten 
 Yeah, times get rough for the best of us 
 And daily life is just way too much 
 'Cause we're riding the waves in the ocean 
 Lost hope and faith and you're feeling crushed 
 We all need to move forward 
 Need to see that there's something more than 
 What we had 'cause we have it all 
 Emotions rise then emotions fall 
 Feel pushed back and against the wall 
 A positive mind will keep you strong 
 Strike the match, ignite the flames 
 So we can carry on 
 You will never lose face by offering a shoulder 
 Bring them into your space when the world seems like it's colder 
 You will never lose face by offering a shoulder 
 Bring them into your space 
 There comes a time in life 
 When someone will want you by their side 
 And need you to keep them strong 
 Alone they fall but we are one 
 There will be a time when everything's fine or so it seems 
 Left with memories, holding onto dreams 
 You will never lose face by offering a shoulder 
 Bring them into your space when the world seems like it's colder
########### No Way Back ###########
There's no way back 
 There's no way back 
 There's no way back 
 Our days are numbered 
 Thought that it was gonna be plain sailing 
 But it's all rain and thunder 
 So we strike like lightning, settling scores 
 As we rape this world for consumption 
 Another country's family's dying through hunger 
 It don't make no sense that's why we gotta push back 
 Not just sit on the fence 
 Infected by a scene, gotta stay focused 
 As we get hit with waves from the ocean 
 A lot of weight on our shoulders; Britain is broken 
 Another generation is evolving 
 While the opposition are still controlling 
 More money, more problems no one's solving 
 And the ozone's still got a hole in 
 There's not much longer to live 
 Turn around; look what you did 
 You created a demon, watch this unfold 
 With every breath days become old 
 There's not much longer to live 
 Turn around; look what you did 
 You created a demon, watch this unfold 
 With every breath days become old 
 We can see things change but it's mainly the climate 
 Yeah, we know most wouldn't bat an eyelid 
 The future is dying, the pressure is rising 
 Hate is spreading like a virus 
 The end is near but the past is behind us 
 We're breaking the silence 
 Get behind us as the coastline decreases 
 On this concrete island 
 We're against everything you believe in 
 We're just spitting the truth, we're not preaching 
 You wanna tell me how the fuck it ever came to this? 
 We gotta rise up; let a better world exist 
 The outcome'll always cause a twist 
 We bite the hand that feeds us shit 
 So is there gonna be a way back? 
 Let's counteract the attack 
 I will wait for you to look me in the eye 
 Feed me your bullshit, feed me your lies 
 Yeah, the view's so sick from the top 
 You just can't get enough, you just can't get enough 
 When you're flying this high there's a higher drop 
 Torn from the sky; there's no way back up 
 There's no way back 
 There's no way back 
 There's not much longer to live 
 Turn around; look what you did 
 You created a demon, watch this unfold 
 With every breath days become old 
 There's not much longer to live 
 Turn around; look what you did 
 You created a demon, watch this unfold 
 With every breath days become old
########### False Idols ###########
We see through your disguise 
 False idols in our eyes 
 We're stronger, we are the 
 We ain't gonna lose no sleep if you hate us 
 Now we're in way too deep on our way up 
 Think we're gonna stop because a fake don't rate us? 
 Boris Johnson cunt ain't gonna save us 
 Keep taxing our wages, we just spit raps in faces 
 Tryna bridge gaps but we are lab rats in cages 
 Trapped in, sick without a vaccine 
 Contagious, so they wanna stay away from us 
 Because of our behaviour 
 Well I don't fucking blame ya 
 'Cause we're not just entertainers 
 (Stay away from the radius) 
 I spit shrapnel that will give you a facelift 
 Do you catch my drift? Hacktivist causing a crisis 
 Let a politician chat shit as I murder the riff 
 We see through your disguise 
 False idols in our eyes 
 We're stronger, we are the 
 The voice of a generation lost in discrimination 
 They step to the stage with nothing to say but waste 
 The voice of a generation lost in discrimination 
 They step to the stage with nothing to show but fame 
 Better know we're setting the pace 
 Everybody wants money, nobody wants change 
 From council estates on minimum wage 
 How the fuck did we get here on the main stage? 
 We won't follow man's lane 
 Clockwork Orange, they can't wash my brain 
 Think I give a fuck about fame? 
 I'll be on the road playing shows with my mates 
 All we need is humanity in this human race 
 Others see black and white but we see grey 
 If you read between the lines you can relate 
 When the kids start shooting at their classmates 
 And their parents blame GTA 
 Selling guns in shops was the first mistake 
 So don't talk to me about fate 
 We see through your disguise 
 False idols in our eyes 
 We're stronger, we are the voice 
 The voice of a generation lost in discrimination 
 (We are the voice) 
 The voice of a generation lost in discrimination 
 (We are the voice) 
 The voice of a generation lost in discrimination 
 They step to the stage with nothing to say but waste 
 The voice of a generation lost in discrimination 
 They step to the stage with nothing to show but fame
########### Rotten ###########
We can just about breathe but we're not alive 
 We can just about breathe but we're not alive 
 Look into the future; will peace be found or man still shoot ya? 
 Technology rises, uses for the greater good or still cause crisis? 
 What's the verdict? We called for God but do you think He heard it? 
 And if He did, did He think mankind was worth it? 
 Did He think we deserved it? 
 Microchips; there's a human circuit 
 Spread worldwide from beneath the surface 
 No green left on the earth, cursed 
 Stuck in reverse, only getting worse 
 We await the grave, won't live long, urban decay 
 Talking about these days gone by, still question why 
 I'll spill any enemy; I don't wanna wake up 
 With cables stuck in my gut 
 And have to cut some chip out my neck 
 To eject all the lies they been tellin' me 
 They keep telling us that the nightmare will end 
 But it never does, we're the rebellers 
 And we tried to defend our heaven 
 But then yet again they deaded us 
 Plugged us into the machine 
 Now we're livin' life in a bad dream 
 I hate being stuck in the baitrix, mate 
 Can't wait to escape and wake up my team 
 Look what the law has become 
 Check what the corporate forces have done 
 We can't run, all the doors have been shut 
 I'm exhausted and cut; World War IV has begun 
 We can just about breathe but we're not alive 
 The sickness begins; see it in our eyes 
 Rotten from the inside out, you can shout, you can scream 
 But in this future world we bleed 
 (We bleed) 
 We can just about breathe but we're not alive 
 The sickness begins; see it in our eyes 
 Rotten from the inside out, you can shout, you can scream 
 But in this world death's the only guarantee 
 Fillin' our brains with the enemies' notions, we counteract explosions 
 I'm a virus, sicker than a back door Trojan, killin' off opponents 
 We are the cyborg soldiers 'cause freedom is the focus 
 You've been warned if you are not strong then you will be left for the vultures 
 I watched World War IV approach us 
 As we enter another dimension 
 Drones hovering, scanning our bodies to take information 
 As we fight alongside the resistance 
 We're the lyrical resurrection, everything's been censored 
 I've been frozen and sectioned 
 My eyes are red, I detect tension like a Skynet invention 
 Yes, listen 
 They failed us, they failed us in stages and lied about it 
 Didn't think that we would write about this 
 Orwellian reality and fight the powers, rah 
 They caged us; promised that they would save us 
 They made us worship their saviors 
 First it was martial law and tasers 
 Now I'm rippin' this ID code from my skin with a razor 
 Wake up, wake up, wake up, too many man'll fall victim 
 Flushed out, get lost in the system 
 So listen; it's too late to appreciate wisdom 
 You're trapped; this is reality 
 I hope you appreciate prison 
 We can just about breathe but we're not alive 
 The sickness begins; see it in our eyes 
 Rotten from the inside out, you can shout, you can scream 
 But in this future world we bleed 
 (We bleed) 
 We can just about breathe but we're not alive 
 The sickness begins; see it in our eyes 
 Rotten from the inside out, you can shout, you can scream 
 But in this world death's the only guarantee 
 Did you really think the government was backing you? 
 Woop woop, yeah, they're attacking you 
 Yeah, yeah, they be lacking too 
 Tell you what we know that they know what we know 
 And I wish I was eleven foot taller 
 Wish I was a bat boy baller 
 Then I could've prevented this or that 
 Put my faith on the line and a gun to my face 
 And it could've been the end of Traxx 
 Hold me back 
 Know a couple brothers that will hold me back 
 Now I got a tracker on my arm and I can't go nowhere 
 I refuse to be abused but I can't fight back 
 And I know you can hear us and I know you can hear us 
 But I can't fight back, I got the brrp on my back 
 (We can just about breathe but we're not alive) 
 (We can just about breathe but we're not alive)
########### Elevate ###########
I wanna take down who's in power 
 Like ground zero; two twin towers 
 The President was a coward, trying to take what's ours 
 Spend money on wars, watch bullets get showered 
 But things ain't gonna change in a matter of hours 
 Until we turn up at the White House, whole crowds of us 
 These suits and ties couldn't walk in our trousers, nah 
 It's riot gear when they surround us 
 I'm a pioneer, Hacktivist; we are the founders 
 The sound of twenty-five thousand voices raised in anger 
 If only you could see it from our angle 
 Another budget cut; another community centre shut, dismantled 
 The system overrun by the power of the gun 
 Families bleed, left with no one 
 It's time for change, time to elevate 
 To a higher place; this world's gone insane 
 What happened to the right side of the brain? 
 This mask covers our face, stand up and say goodbye 
 To this daylight robbery of lives, the elite gotta do their time 
 Set 'em up for the firing line 
 Too quick to point the finger 
 Too quick to pull the trigger 
 Slaughter the innocent, I see no sense 
 We fight fire with fire, we won't burn 
 A middle finger for liars that won't learn 
 We fight fire with fire, we won't burn 
 A middle finger for liars that won't learn 
 We stand firm 
 There's strength in numbers, we're ninety-nine, they're one 
 For the suits up high there's nowhere to hide or run 
 We flow through the streets like blood 
 Hats down, hoods up, this system's fucked 
 What I see is corrupt, learn who to trust 
 H won't give up 
 They don't move in our circle 
 Stand up and listen; we're breaking the rules 
 Never fall, stay strong, eternal inferno 
 We stand tall raising a torch 
 'Cause we got that lyrical force for the side that you walk 
 Bodies lined out in chalk for supporting the cause 
 We settle the score, fight 'cause this is our war 
 We fight fire with fire, we won't burn 
 A middle finger for liars that won't learn 
 We fight fire with fire, we won't burn 
 A middle finger for liars that won't learn 
 We stand firm 
 We will stand firm 
 We will stand firm 
 The system overrun by the power of the gun 
 Families bleed, left with no one 
 It's time for change, time to elevate 
 To a higher place; the world's gone insane 
 What happened to the right side of the brain? 
 Straight 
 The system overrun by the power of the gun 
 Families bleed, left with no one 
 It's time for change, time to elevate 
 To a higher place; the world's gone insane 
 What happened to the right side of the brain?
########### Outside The Box ###########
So we got thrown in at the deep end, didn't test the water 
 Made a splash in the scene with a sound 
 That they ain't ever heard of 
 There will be many now but there was none before us 
 We're gonna remain flawless 
 Thanks for all the support, it's been awesome 
 Coming from The Craufurd, going on tour with Korn 'round Europe 
 'Cause we live how we sound, outside the box 
 Cross borders, causing storms in forums 
 Fuck a genre 'cause that's not important 
 We're on the frontline, we are not trolls on keyboards exporting nonsense 
 Or a sandwich short in a lunch box; we are the full mont 
 Turn the sound up another notch, we just tell it how it is 
 They applaud us, yeah, they applaud us 
 Sat in my room and my head starts spinning 
 Painting a story, creating an image 
 Translating these thoughts to lyrics 
 We are full of substance, no need for gimmicks 
 We've achieved so much but it's just like we're warming up 
 Some said we'd never make it 
 Ha, you really think H ever gave a fuck? 
 And through this we gained our respect 
 Connecting with fans, deep thoughts 
 Sick shows, lyrical intellect 
 And we are here right now 
 There's no "coming up next" 
 So tighten your belt 
 This time you're coming for a ride 
 (This time you're coming for a ride) 
 As these five minds collide
########### Buszy ###########
Who said that rest comes easily? 
 You said that, might just need to be 
 Put down, ain't standin' around 
 Our heads in the clouds but feet on the ground 
 Believe me you will see me 
 Living a life freely, rise up like a wheelie 
 Take a step back, look what we achieved 
 Straight up passion, not about P's 
 Forever we aim high on the same level 
 Looking up at the same sky 
 Deep in the music, up to the waistline 
 So we're gonna do this, ain't gonna waste time 
 There's a lot of plastic shit in this metal life 
 Bare bands but nothing like us five 
 It's our time, we're keeping it alive 
 Our home is where the road is so you better know this 
 We'll take on the world, there's no sleep tonight 
 So high we take flight 
 We touch the sky, feeling so alive 
 Six a.m., still buzzing 
 We won't stop for nothing 
 Six a.m. on the tour bus carnage 
 That's where it started, licking off bottles, no dramas 
 I'm supposed to be saving my voice but I can't stop laughing 
 We give a hundred percent, never go half hearted 
 H is an army advancing our way to the target 
 So positive, we've already made it big, regardless 
 You see me on the podium 
 Rise above all, high like opium 
 Got too much heart 
 And this is just the start 
 We'll take on the world, there's no sleep tonight 
 So high we take flight 
 We touch the sky, feeling so alive 
 Six a.m., still buzzing 
 We won't stop for nothing 
 We will take on the world, there's no sleep tonight 
 So high we take flight 
 We touch the sky, feeling so alive
########### The Storm II ###########
We will return, yeah 
 Unified, we are not alone 
 Born from the stars and we will return 
 Unified, yeah, we're not alone 
 Born from the stars and we will return 
 We will return, yeah

 Flow so hard "Your whip so cold", what this old thing?

You all remind me of cancers, who burn every bridge

 Now the truth has risen 
 From the chained book 
 That told you to be honest 
 But it caught you red-handed 
 Look into the crimson sky that is covered with shades of of gray, which army has yet to come 
 This tragedy is dragging you down a one-way path 
 There is no true escape, when fate has changed 
 And another bridge is in ruin yet again 
 This solitary requiem ends the battle in the streets 
 By insulting your creator, you also destroyed yourself 
 And now your bridge burns to its own demise

 The time runs thin for redemption 
 Our only need is to sacrifice our souls before th dawn.

 And remember we drew your chalk lines. 
 We are taking everything!

 Cloaked in immense beauty and infinite ruin

 Look at them now they have stolen the truth, 
 Look at us now forever enslaved.

########### Bilo Pt. 1 ###########
I'm starting to think about the things that put us on the track on life, that might make us miss what's beyond the train we are traveling on. 
 If you live the life that doesn't fulfill you, and if you live your life just because you have to, you are not actually going towards anything, you are just along for a ride.
########### Bilo Pt. 2 ###########
I do not consider myself less ignorant than most people. I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books. I have begun to listen to the teachings my blood whispers to me 
 No man has ever been entirely and completely himself. Yet each one strives to become that, one in an awkward, the other in a more intelligent way, each as best he can.
########### Bilo Pt. 4 ###########

Fear is effortless, fear is blind 
 Crumbs of fear in our smiles 
 Stopped the train of feelings, forgot our hearts 
 Now we use our minds 
 Fear is sadness, fear is endless, it makes our skin peel 
 I give up, the phobia is real 
 I've been trying for too long, it doesn't work I can't stop this wheel, 
 Just one smile or just one tear, anything that makes them feel 
 Imagine you have just one moment, 
 Where would you place it, how would you give it? 
 Make those liquid emotions collide and loose your mind! 
 Racing time, out of body, disinclined, 
 Goals or life it's not easy to decide, 
 Frosted faces waiting in the line, 
 I'm trying to melt them. I try to make them smile. 
 Touch can leave a scar, 
 Lights can make you go blind, 
 I can't stop this wheel, just one smile or just one tear, 
 Anything that makes them feel alive 
 Imagine you have just one moment, 
 Where would you place it, how would you give it? 
 Make those liquid emotions collide and loose your mind! 
 Racing time, out of body, disinclined, 
 Goals or life it's not easy to decide, 
 Frosted faces waiting in the line, 
 I'm trying to melt them. I try to make them smile.

Dreaming of all the big things, 
 But can't you see it, 
 You have to be asleep to believe it,

 Looking at stars, 
 Waiting for them to fall 
 If you had one moment, 
 Moment to love, moment to breathe, 
 How would you live it? 
 See the world, 
 Drown in the sea of tears, 
 Feel the pain, 
 Caused by the deepest fears, 
 If you had one moment, 
 moment to bleed, moment to give, 
 how would you live it? 
 Stay alive, in black and white, 
 But try to feel the light, 
 Seeing colors feeding your eyesight, 
 Get out, join the life, 
 Don't try to hide inside, 
 Dark side of your restless mind.

########### El Grito ###########
[VERSE I: Dr.Faustus] 
 Forced to conform to the will of the oppressors 
 This shiny gold you sought never really impressed us 
 We the savage defend against civilized aggressors 
 The children of the lesser 
 Broken spirits mend to oppose foreign transgressors 
 Native in loincloth baring gifts taken as obscene gesture 
 Spanish conquest comes from emaciated pale skin creeps 
 Shallow men void of love is the company sin keeps 
 Throughout the years we've come to overstand political science 
 Sovereignty attained through Boriqua-Cuban alliance 
 Flags wave similar to remind us of defiance 
 Y'all never saw it comin', island nations becomin' giants 
 Globalization, non-compliance 
 Genocide to indian tribes 
 Siboney, Taino, Hatuey, Mayans 
 Los tiraflecha got arrows flyin' 
 God you must hear my cries 
 This slain son of yours make 'em thirst for our heathen demise 
 Convince them Shaman also wise 
 Even if we decide to hide our hides under animal hides 
 We are not savage, we verbalize 
 In a different language, our land's ravished 
 Us in poverty, them living lavish 
 Why does it continue? Indigenous people considered 
 below average 
 [Chorus:] 
 The dominance of a people powered by the sun 
 chased and hunted down 'til the land is overrun 
 action added to the adage, "We shall overcome" 
 Spear must pierce flesh quicker than soldier's gun 
 RELAX, RELATE, RELEASE, SCREAM 
 Attack! debase the beast's dream 
 His nightmare filled with guerrilla rebels 
 death is a blessing given to these devils 
 [VERSE 2: Seth P. Brundel] 
 Llena de sangre 
 Una espada clavada en el alma de la tierra 
 con huella Española 
 Ellas no llegaron solas 
 Con las de corporaciones 
 Naciones fascistas

 Violando la isla que grita con cáncer en los riñones 
 Sus habitantes asmáticos pescando peces que no hacen 
 burbujas por meses 
 Quitense los lentes y enfoquen 
 Fuck it 
 Vamos hacer ejercicios militares con químicos tóxicos 
 que matan al instante 
 en el patio de la Casa Blanca 
 la casa del narcotráfico 
 que trágico Lola 
 el mundo se ha vuelto Calle Luna Calle Sol 
 Agarra tu pistola 
 Ve con Juanito Alimaña no vayas sola 
 Dile que el día de la suerte viene ante la muerte y roba 
 Documentos clasificados de la Agencia Central de Inteligencia y explota 
 Transmite vía radio rebelde la gente que se vende por 
 un dólar le cortamos la lengua y el bembe Entiende 
 Quieren que nos quedemos ignorantes y sin educación 
 Recuerden el masacre de Panamá las miles de personas 
 que mataron afusilaron y no enseñaron por televisión 
 El Grupo 8 está involucrado 
 En asuntos más profundos que un toto sin fondo 
 Qué somos? 
 Busquen los Macheteros locos por darle 
 un machetazo al brazo de la justicia 
 La injusticia 
 Si Latino América se unen rápido como una brisa 
 Mejoramos nuestro estado

[VERSE I] 
 There's no turning back- I left my home burning in flames this morning 
 Knowing the day after creates a new day dawning 
 This is the season of the non-conformist 
 The arms race where the hare is beaten by the tortoise 
 More like the bald eagle getting' scalped from within his fortress 
 The higher purpose issues 
 Put this in your headline news 
 The hateful man from Iraq 
 I wrap 
 a long stem of thorns around the heartland of America 
 Achy 
 Breaky 
 hate me 
 scarin' ya 
 Okey 
 Dokey 
 Oklahoma bombing blame me 
 Suspect unknown stereotype and name me 
 Then you wonder why we extremists 
 we dealing with a nation run by demons 
 Concocting devious government bodies, F-U-C-K 
 all your D.E.A.'s 
 and F.E.M.A.'s 
 Your regime 
 means 
 to steam 
 roll all opposing themes 
 Those with the slightest melanin in genes 
 always considered the away team 
 Foreign policies transform into broken promises 
 Can't even fathom exactly what honest is 
 Dirty rotten lowdown scoundrels dispense the cruel 
 promise blacks 40 acres and a mule 
 All they got was 40 ounces and a stool 
 Description of existence- life's a bitch and breathing's for fools 
 tragedy rules 
 Inhale gas and choke on toxic fumes 
 Blue skies tremble at the mercy of grey smoke from fossil fuels 
 Did we all want chaos to run amok 
 Livin' a vampire's life 
 Reality bites and blood sucks 
 'Til your zombie like 
 and don't give a fuck 
 But that's all gonna change now 
 [VERSE II] 
 Never exercising their rights- freedom of speech atrophy 
 Fear of conflict with bully big brother watching breeds apathy 
 Torture loyal citizens 
 of this wicked system/ leavin' 'em with severed tongue 
 Let freedom ring but it never rung 
 Mute affluent bumbs 
 force rambles 
 of shabby renditions of a national anthem left in shambles 
 Half-hearted patriotism 
 Parents now slaves to their children 
 Columbine high school reunion sensationalism 
 21 gun 
 megaton 
 atomic salute 
 for this government and its self-destructive attributes 
 Chickens coming home to roost 
 This act you call terrorist provides third world populace with ego boost 
 Aggressions eliminate possibility of truce 
 Us considered minority but you comb the streets for new recruits 
 Uncle Sam your nephews wanna show what you've trained them to do 
 Stress blue collars in the name of increased tax revenue 
 Children work their fingers to the bone in sweatshops 
 Rest at night in mud huts 
 Adolescent have-nots 
 nourished in economic cell blocks 
 acquire nutrition from well developed in god we trust 
 blood lust 
 They claw, scratch 
 and scrape for scraps 
 Asthma grips and grabs 
 hold they breath with iron grasp 
 until they lungs collapse 
 Sick and tired choosin' lesser of two evils in ballot box booby traps 
 Behemoth industrial complex shall be made simpler 
 The world ends with a bang as you whimper 
 [VERSE III] 
 My reasons for doing this are noble 
 The grievances of my people must be made vocal 
 This global 
 world cursed with the same destiny of Chernobyl 
 Under their fearful breaths they sing songs of freedom 
 Each individual aware the greater good supercedes 'em 
 A powerful peace comes over your grand cities 
 Rebels in the trenches doing the dirty work with hands shitty 
 No sympathy for Mephisto the oppressed won't ever grant pity 
 Beware, be cautious 
 Armed forces weakened by heavy losses 
 Police departments blown to bits with countless grenade tosses 
 Poisonous chemicals spewing from faucets 
 got the upper class feeling nautious 
 Nuclear winter the coldest equalizer 
 Racist power structure destabilizer 
 What if the wretched victims of imperialism were to rise up 
 The ignorant were to wise up 
 Underground radiation shelters too quickly use supplies up 
 New World Order conspirators break their ties up 
 Revolutionaries organized crossed their T's and dot their I's up 
 The greatest opposition to liberty were sized up 
 Flip the Earth like a coin, hope for the right side up 
 Self-defeated suicide down war criminal homicide up 
 Global warming melt polar caps and raise the tide up 
 What would you do? Time's up

These tunes we perform 
 be only a score 
 for ritual endured 
 When we uphold the pure cure

 Needing presence in the present to lift it 
 Spiritual growth a breath away but still resisted 
 These thoughts valid for our time 
 This flame shines 
 Its aim 
 to inspire 
 before we expire 
 Hear psalms happily sung by the angel's choir 
 Fire back don't let the escalator backfire 
 A man born to fight reckless for his ideals 
 Food for thought, deep concentration, struggle for the meal 
 Never at odds with what my gut feels 
 I rush to my destiny with the speed of the wings on 
 Mercury's heels 
 It gets me to move swiftly 
 Chances of success fifty-fifty 
 Cut corners off these squares and give 'em 360 
 The ills of society are in us 
 We the sinners 
 looking for someone to forgive us 
 In a wicked world hoping our children outlive us 
 Some offspring meet the doctor's saber and never the cradle 
 Homicide committed in pre-natal 
 Most crime stories end as death fable 
 Seth P. mortician, magician, musician 
 whose music is fatal 
 Realm Disciples struggle with the mud in the soul 
 Our cold stares are bold 
 I relate to the book of Job 
 Claw my way to the apex on knee and elbows 
 Such thoughts terrifies those 
 who never chose 
 to think with such imagination 
 This is liberation 
 poison in the rat race 
 Pavlovian salivation 
 rabid slobberin' salvation

[VERSE I] 
 A poet of the streets who struggles with his own derangement 
 The meek are skeletal remains under the pavement 
 Made my peace with god we've made an arrangement 
 He won't interfere in my affairs provided I make truthful statements 
 That translates into people's feelings dead by the wayside 
 Bruised egos remain when I slay pride 
 No faith in the masses y'all won't see me stage dive 
 This type of solitude plagued Van Gogh to hear in mono 
 Multiple personalities second guess themselves and squabble 
 A heart encased in cold metal 
 A stubborn demeanor that makes the bold settle 
 Bare feet scented with the fragrance of rose petals 
 Russian roulette with five shots 
 Soon I'll be at peace with the stress I've got 
 This revolver's mine 
 This revolver shines 
 Irrational logic of the faltered kind 
 This bum right here's the prince and the pauper combined 
 This peasant rich spirited 
 This prince inconsiderate 
 Divine disenchanted genius illiterate 
 This so-called life must get rid of it 
 STOP BOTHERING ME! 
 [VERSE II] 
 While the sun's in a coma the moon envies 
 Happy ball of fire never sees the bowels of hell empty 
 into the streets/ The glowing orb jealous of the warmth and the heat 
 The witness from above never feels peace he sees 
 In the dead of night alter boys molested by priests 
 Pious men behind closed doors cuddle close with the beast 
 Battered wives raped on bloody sheets 
 Innocent men of color slaughtered by police 
 Neglected children starving and thirsty drink tears as they weep 
 Corrupt lawyers on the edge overdose in they sleep 
 Addicts so far gone rehab clinic gave 'em release 
 Neighbors gossip 'bout each other when the fake smiles cease 
 Grave robbers seek wealth when they steal from deceased 
 Possessive pimp creeps/ smack their prostitute freaks 
 Evil industry dispose of toxic waste with leaks 
 Betray public trust politician lies through his teeth when he speaks 
 The sanity of citizens fully decreased/ Superstition 
 dictates the mind of the weak 
 And they all/ got the gaul/ to blame it all/ on the full moon 
 Darkness consumes 
 But the sun awakens soon 
 [VERSE III] 
 I find myself drowning in shallow cup is half empty symbolism 
 Yoko Ono stank puss growth stunted by simple jism 
 Shame held them captive 
 Lack of love 
 full of lust 
 kept them active 
 Fleetwood Mac(k)-ing 
 these phrases 
 Goin' my own way emotional laxative 
 Releases rages 
 Relations go through phases 
 Nothing new to pseudo bible banger Jezebel Magdalene 
 Her shoulders pinned up against stone wall outside the club handlin' 
 Strange private parts she just met over a couple of drinks babblin' 
 Then she got the balls to show up to her Sunday cult church gatherin' 
 Hypocrites to the highest power 
 Slice of lime in her drink to remind her about her 
 bitter life going sour 
 Where's the redeeming quality 
 Living life in the fast lane losing control of velocity 
 A bratty little girl sees you as role model-what an atrocity 
 Two women with bad self images do what they know best to raise a child 
 One lives the life of a lifeless doll while 
 The other roams comatose in a carcass used as a mobile/ Sperm bank 
 For any Tom, Dick and Hank 
 The little girl ain't got a chanc

[VERSE I] 
 It all began with the crying of children 
 Searching the cold landscape for something to get the blanks filled in 
 Boiling temperatures had the paint on the walls peeling 
 The shit done hit the fan now maneur dripping off the ceiling 
 I directly below showered in excrement 
 Bitterly refusing the recommended daily dose of medicine 
 Bible scriptures just a play thing, making spitballs 
 out of the new and old testament 
 Immersed in a demented game of chicken with my own shadows 
 Screaming let my image go to the silhouette pharoah 
 He won't budge 
 I won't shake/ He won't move/ I won't escape 
 There's no judge, it ain't safe 
 I must soothe 
 These headaches 
 Unrest got me biting my fingernails down to the knuckle 
 Solitaire with a deck of cards unshuffled 
 My land lady provided me with a patch of leathery 
 flesh to keep my mouth muffled 
 I must repent I scuffle 
 with a couple 
 of heavy belt buckles 
 Whipping 'em across my back creating welts and sore muscles 
 It shall never cease until I cleanse my soul 
 [VERSE II] 
 A dozen picture frames picture frames shattered on the bathroom floor 
 A spouse who chose adultery over matrimony forever yours 
 Blood stains the tile 
 Tic Tac Toe style 
 My X won it all- The dog, the house, the cars, the 
 bank accounts, the kids and all the while 
 I'm slowly going down 
 the stairway to heaven like a slinky hellbound 
 I'm lost in a spiral defeated fetal position 
 A train of thought with an altered course headed for fatal collision 
 The jagged glass stepping stones as I hopscotch with wounded feet 
 Misery serenades me with tunes of mystique 
 Hide and seek 
 Enchanting isn't it 
 This damning dizziness 
 In a whirlwind twister raving and ranting silliness 
 The night the music stopped 
 and blind thieves with horns watched 
 and stared 
 As I wallow in self-pity and despair 
 No reason to keep up the pace but no place to take 
 five they've stolen my chair 
 The odd man out- I'm it tagging Jack daniels with alcohol abuse 
 I duck duck goose 
 a makeshift noose 
 hanging from the ceiling fan 
 Pinata loathing the tattered remains of a broken down family man 
 What went wrong, what was missing, I try to spell it out 
 The grief overwhelms I gotta yell it out 
 Pass out on a sofa bed couch 
 It'll be a new day tomorrow 
 I must suppress the sorrow 
 Or face the possibility of losing my profession 
 I'll do my best to counsel that dysfunctional family 
 during their next session

As we grow with rusty nails in the coffin among potential of diamonds and pearls. 
 This sea of blood fills the crevice between our lifeless body and the whispers for which we reach. 
 Behold as the water floods the red. 
 Time commands of us to meet again in silence. 
 Awakening to a higher light. 
 If we sever the distance between one another, and cross out the fear we learn, all are one and nothing is keeping the love in our souls from bursting infinitely. 
 Now what have we become? 
 An entity of survival. 
 Rotting flesh of the fallen stains our ego. 
 Now the moment is at hand to rise above what was once so prevalent. 
 Folding time within the mortal boundaries lived upon. 
 Moving onward. We will never fade. 
 Fall into another dead end. Will it end the same? 
 Lines are drawn for the rest of the story. 
 If we sever the distance between one another, and cross out the fear we learn, all are one and nothing is keeping the love in our souls from bursting infinitely. 
 This life is one that we must live. 
 The peace once embraced from so long ago sleeps deep within our mind. 
 Stay forever or be erased from the harmonic physical state of being existing in this dimension. 
 Lies are covered, but only for the moment. 
 The blood of the weak will carve the way for the innocent. 
 The blood of the weak will carve the way for the innocent.

 Please just leave me and move on 
 All of the things you said that you are 
 Oh my love 
 Every time you said you will try 
 Oh my love 
 Everything's gone and I don't want it back 
 Oh my love 
 Can you see what have you done 
 You think that I want you back 
 I don't 
 I feel so lucky now 
 After you're gone 
 All of the things you said that you are 
 Oh my love 
 Every time you said you will change 
 Oh my love 
 Everything's gone and I don't want it back 
 Oh my love 
 Can you see what have you done 
 Can you see what have you done.
########### Take A Picture ###########
Come take a picture 
 If only you knew, what I would do for you. 
 I want to feel you, and I can see right through. 
 What do I have to do, why can't this truth be told? 
 I want to get inside the dark side.. 
 If only you knew, what I would do for you. 
 I want to feel you, and I can see right through. 
 What do I have to do, why can't this truth be told? 
 I want to get inside the dark side of you. 
 Come take a picture, as it could be the last, 
 Thing the remember, from your.. 
 Come take a picture, no you can't run away, 
 I will hunt you down as if you were my prey. 
 Come take a picture, as it will be the last, 
 Thing the remember, from your past. 
 Come take a picture, as it will be the last, 
 Thing you see from a broken heart... 
 Grahhh 
 (Aaaahhhh) 
 If only I had you in my arms, 
 There is nothing that I wouldn't do. 
 If I could have you close to me. 
 Close to you. 
 Come take a picture 
 If only you knew, what I would do for you, 
 But loving someone for you is a taboo. 
 What do I have to do, why can't this kiss be true? 
 I swallow all the things you're pushing me through.

 If only I had you in my arms, 
 There is nothing that I wouldn't do. 
 If I could have you close to me. 
 Close to you. 
 There is a story behind my smile, 
 I just don't know how far you could go. 
 When I let you come close to me, 
 Close to you.

########### Love Song ###########
I can't define what a feeling 
 I'm lost for words 
 You don't see my heart bleeding 
 I can't stand it no more 
 You screamed, I laughed, and you break down 
 You say I'm mad 
 You know it's more than a game now 
 Maybe it's all in your head 
 Don't you know what I mean? 
 Is it possible? 
 Can we lose it all? 
 'Cause you saw the worst in me 
 And I know 
 That I'll never let you go 
 I know, you know, yeah we both know 
 How this will end 
 Open you mouth, say you hate me 
 There's no need to pretend 
 Don't you know what I mean? 
 Is it possible? 
 Can we lose it all? 
 'Cause you saw the worst in me 
 And I know 
 That I'll never let you go 
 Screw you, fuck you, mmmm, I hate you 
 This time for real 
 I simply want to forget you 
 This beaten heart needs time to heal 
 Don't you know what I mean? 
 Is it possible? 
 Can we lose it all? 
 'Cause you saw the worst in me 
 And I know 
 That I'll never let you go

Close your eyes now, and look around. 
 Describe all the places, that you have found. 
 Can you, can you, can you be around? 
 Do you, do you, really feel the sound? 
 Cut your skin and, reach inside. 
 Use your mind. 
 Don't be blind. 
 Can you, can you, can you be around? 
 Do you, do you, really feel the sound? 
 Can you, can you, can you be around? 
 Do you, do you, really feel the sound? 
 The pain is gone it's fading, 
 I cannot take this anymore. 
 My life is masquerading. 
 Walk away and shut the door. 
 There is no time for blaming. 
 All the things you have said and done, 
 The pain turns into hating, 
 And I cannot give anymore time. 
 Now is your time to realize, 
 A new day is coming. 
 Open your eyes. 
 Can you, can you, can you be around?

########### House Of Lies ###########
There were days when I was down, 
 When I had no one around. 
 But the thought that you were there for me, 
 But you turned your back so easily. 
 There you were you spoke those words, 
 Of all the words I never heard. 
 And you try to break what's left of me. 
 I just wonder how I couldn't see. 
 I don't know who you are, 
 I don't know where to start, 
 When all our love you tore apart. 
 You don't know who I am, 
 And you don't understand, 
 That I will never let this end. 
 I used to think we had it all. 
 But you just loved to see me crawl. 
 And no matter how fast I would run, 
 You would always make me come undone. 
 Every time I seemed okay, 
 I would always feel shame. 
 I was trapped inside your house of lies, 
 And I try to leave but I'm paralyzed. 
 I don't know who you are, 
 I don't know where to start, 
 When all our love you tore apart. 
 You don't know who I am, 
 And you don't understand, 
 That I will never let this end. 
 All along, 
 So wrong, 
 I always thought you'd be here, 
 Never thought you'd disappear. 
 All along, 
 So wrong, 
 I tried and tried but I won't let you go! 
 I don't know who you are, 
 I don't know where to start, 
 When all our love you tore apart. 
 You don't know who I am, 
 And you don't understand, 
 That I will never let this end.
########### Addict ###########
I know you at least I think I do, 
 You control my mind and my body too. 
 I thought I made myself damn clear, 
 But you would never disappear! 
 Inside this hidden room, 
 I'll try to fight with you! 
 I dropped you once, 
 And I'll drop you once again! 
 From myself, from my life, 
 But scar remains. 
 Feels like flirting with suicide. 
 All this pain is playing with my mind. 
 I thought I made myself damn clear, 
 But you would never disappear! 
 Inside this hidden room, 
 I'll try to fight with you! 
 Ah, oh, etc. 
 I dropped you once, 
 And I'll drop you once again! 
 From myself, from my life, 
 But scar remains. 
 One second becomes 
 Like a year when thoughts collide; 
 I wanna brake everything and stay alive! 
 In this room, I'll fight with you! 
 (Ah-ah-ah-ah!) 
 Pounding waves of liquid overload running through my nerves and my brain! 
 The carcass of dream lies dead. 
 I'm hopping to find 1 hole under these 4 walls to catch my breath! 
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
 I dropped you once, 
 And I'll drop you once again! 
 From myself, from my life, 
 But scar remains. 
 One second becomes 
 Like a year when thoughts collide; 
 I wanna brake everything and stay alive.

As my senses evolve, I need to learn to stand my ground 
 I am forced into a shaking world where all I need is safe and sound 
 I am not satisfied 
 Looking into a mirror, but I don't really think I need to reflect 
 I am unrealistically happy, although I know it's just a state of neglect 
 I am not satisfied 
 As the fire burns, I'm standing still 
 I'm paralyzed and cold (watch my dreams unfold) 
 I am almost liquid and although I'm breathing 
 I am dead (although I'm breathing, I am dead) 
 I am second in line when all they needed was number one 
 I am sitting in the corner of that circle they placed me in 
 I am not satisfied 
 As the fire burns, I'm standing still 
 I'm paralyzed and cold (watch my dreams unfold) 
 I am almost liquid and although I'm breathing 
 I am dead (although I'm breathing, I am dead) 
 I don't mean to disagree but it just seems that I am lost 
 In situations that won't 
 Ever turn out in my favour 
 I just might give in 
 It just seems that I will always live my life face down 
 And still I am not satisfied 
 And still I am not satisfied 
 As the fire burns, I'm standing still 
 I'm paralyzed and cold (watch my dreams unfold) 
 I am almost liquid and although I'm breathing 
 I am dead (although I'm breathing I am dead)

(Is that all you've got? 
 Is that all you've got? 
 Is that all you've got? 
 Is that all you've got? 
 I've got one for you) 
 Did you not make me 
 Take the blame for you 
 Did you not take me for a fool 
 And then you made me cry 
 What did you achieve 
 Blood/hate, I believe 
 Watch as I deceive you in Hell 
 Did you not make me 
 Take the blame for you 
 Did you not take me for a fool 
 And then you made me cry 
 What did you achieve? 
 Blood/hate, I believe 
 Watch as I deceive you in Hell 
 So you lived your life 
 On a level of indiscretion 
 Which I've never seen 
 Your ignorance 
 Makes my silent anger 
 Just wake up and scream 
 It's bloodstained 
 So in all this hate (hate) 
 And suffering (suffering) 
 It makes me go insane 
 Twistin' and turning 
 To avoid the burning 
 That is this pain 
 Did you not make me 
 Take the blame for you 
 Did you not take me for a fool 
 And then you made me cry 
 What did you achieve? 
 Blood/hate, I believe 
 Watch as I deceive you in Hell 
 Did you not make me 
 Take the blame for you 
 Did you not take me for a fool 
 And then you made me cry 
 What did you achieve? 
 Blood/hate, I believe 
 Watch as I deceive you in Hell 
 So you would like me to 
 Go down on you 
 Face it, I won't 
 Let you win this 
 So you spit in my face 
 Still I get up and scream 
 Is that all that you got 
 I got more for you 
 Your past will catch up with you 
 So take your chances now 
 So you blame it all (all) 
 On the use and abuse (your abuse) 
 Of your sad power (sad) 
 But I'm sad to hear 
 Your arrogant excuses (excuse) 
 As I break you 
 In your finest hour 
 Did you not make me 
 Take the blame for you 
 Did you not take me for a fool 
 And then you made me cry 
 What did you achieve? 
 Blood/hate, I believe 
 Watch as I deceive you in Hell 
 Did you not make me 
 Take the blame for you 
 Did you not take me for a fool 
 And then you made me cry 
 What did you achieve? 
 Blood/hate, I believe 
 Watch as I deceive you in Hell 
 So I say 
 Did you not fuck it up 
 Did you pay when your greed 
 Just couldn't stop 
 All that time 
 Did you ever think of me? 
 But in time I will 
 Make you understand 
 Ironically, I will 
 Make you understand 
 You will violently 
 Learn to know my name
########### Ghost ###########
I made you 
 And your hate to 
 Socialize in a matter 
 That suits me fine 
 So while I breathe in 
 You punched my teeth in 
 I tried to explain it but 
 You just don't, just don't see 
 I, I see right through you 
 So you do things 
 Mainly bad things 
 Is it to satisfy 
 Your own neurotic needs 
 I got this feeling 
 I'm just dreaming 
 But just make sure 
 I'm awake when you punish me 
 Come, follow me 
 To that place where 
 We both see 
 What happened to you 
 I need to see if it's all true 
 Confide in me 
 I was blind but now I 
 I see right through 
 All that you do 
 But though I see you 
 I know you're not 
 Here with me 
 And still I try to 
 Explain to you 
 How your presence is 
 Affecting my state of mind 
 Well, suck me in 
 Inside myself 
 I want to 
 Fucking taste myself 
 It drags me down 
 Your dismal past 
 And all you want 
 Is to make that last 
 Well, suck me in 
 Inside myself 
 I want to 
 Fucking taste myself 
 It drags me down 
 Your dismal past 
 And all you want 
 Is to make that last 
 Well, suck me in 
 Inside myself 
 I want to 
 Fucking taste myself 
 It drags me down 
 Your dismal past 
 And all you want 
 Is to make that last 
 Don't want this 
 It's true what they say 
 Ignorance is bliss 
 I'll find another way 
 In my mind 
 It's all good now 
 I don't do things 
 That's abnormal 
 They'll take me 
 And put me away 
 Listen to me when 
 I tell you I'm not insane 
 I, I see right through you 
 I, I see right through you

He's been told that he can't do wrong 
 to a lonely child that cries in his song 
 to understand the mans depravation 
 but to him an invitation 
 so He came in, 
 the child turned its head and its a sin 
 how his eyes looked all dead then. 
 What he saw, the fear on his face 
 could wait no more. Heart-stabbed and disgraced 
 Double crossed 
 That's a double cross 
 backstabbin' doublecross 
 heart stabbin' doublecross, 
 his pain and his loss 
 In his eyes was the recognition 
 of a nasty face whose hurt and mission 
 has fucked a life of bodily prison. 
 It's consequence of a sick mans vision 
 he made a move 
 the gun went off and he changed the mood into blood coloured madness. 
 All he saw was the shadow of a grown man 
 and flesh was raw as he fell down again. 
 All he ever wanted to be was that man 
 Did he ever stand up and see for himself 
 Never wanted that intimacy, nor that fear 
 If he would only reach out to me I'd show him life 
 And that I can't stand you make me sick 
 Have you seen the tears that the boy cries 
 Have you seen the pain that he wears inside 
 So alive, the pain ensures that he really feels like a part of the damned. 
 Such a bitch, joy and smile are long gone, its just hate in small child rape land 
 he's all locked up in a room with his devil it's all fucked up. 
 He's going down in pure revenge, so he saw how his best friend helped him 
 study and the score: justice done, a dead body 
 All he ever wanted to be was that man 
 Did he ever stand up and see for himself 
 Never wanted that intimacy, nor that fear 
 If he would only reach out to me I'd show him life 
 Wont you wait for him, wont you wait for him 
 They took all he had, what's left is all in his head.

(What the fuck is wrong with you? 
 Depressed again or just gone insane again? 
 Don't know what it is, but I can't stand it anymore 
 I'm strugglin' to cope, showing off again 
 See my scars and tattoos? I wear mine on the inside 
 A constant annoyment in a moment that already scares me and everyone else 
 Is that what you want? A concentrated glass 
 Bowl of despair, panic and sorrow, I fuckin' wear mine on the inside 
 I still need to ask a question though, because I need to know 
 What's your definition of arrogance? Is that what's shining through?) 
 Try to break me down 
 I'm immune to your disease 
 Look into my eyes and 
 Then take one step back, please 
 Execute deception 
 All pathetic and depraved 
 There'll be no exception as 
 To where my words are engraved 
 No relief 
 An everlasting mind in peace 
 Reality doesn't hurt me 
 But it will hurt you again 
 Pain inflicted 
 Sentence convicted 
 I don't need to see this through 
 Easy solution 
 Made from hard confusion 
 I think you know the end 
 No relief 
 An everlasting mind in peace 
 Reality doesn't hurt me 
 But it will hurt you again 
 Conquer the same old past 
 I don't regret 
 Anger, it seems to last in me 
 You say I'm sick 
 I'm just confused 
 To why my mind 
 Seems so abused 
 I'm not 
 I need to take on myself 
 Only to teach myself 
 Is that's what's hurting you now 
 I will be hurting you now 
 No matches 
 As my eye, it catches 
 You're unable to see 
 No regrets 
 I'm taking all bets 
 All arranged by me 
 Try to break me down 
 I'm immune to your disease 
 Look into my eyes and 
 Then take one step back, please 
 Execute deception 
 All pathetic and depraved 
 There'll be no exception as 
 To where my words are engraved 
 No relief 
 An everlasting mind in peace 
 Reality doesn't hurt me 
 But it will hurt you again 
 In time you will see truth

You know I can be like that man you can't see 
 Guess what's hiding in me 
 It's that thing I stole from in sickness 
 I know you'll clean this blood off my business and embrace me 
 Now you can't stand it (don't ask me to) 
 Help just 'cause you're stranded (I don't want to) 
 You know where you'll end up (not in my head) 
 Screamin' and alone (between the naked and the dead) 
 Souls are lost in my kingdom 
 I've waited to see what you could bring 
 You'll fall 
 You'll fall into my possession, then you'll see 
 I'm Judas in black and I love it 
 You'll fall into my hands 
 Where's your ripcord? Hate me 
 Feel deceived and hated, thought you would make it 
 Hold that glass and break it 
 Pull that smile and fake it 
 Sit up and spit up 
 Really wish you would wake up 
 Souls are lost in my kingdom 
 I've waited to see what you could bring 
 I'm heedless as I take you in 
 And feed you my mind and sin 
 You'll fall into my possession, then you'll see 
 I'm Judas in black and I love it 
 You'll fall into my hands 
 Where's your ripcord? Hate me 
 The purest of all black and damned souls 
 Now I've claimed what was yours 
 And I will use it as I damn well please 
 You'll see me coming but you won't feel 
 As I enter your body and rip out the real you 
 Inside you is me 
 As you act I breathe 
 Guess what's up my sleeve

########### Closed Eyes ###########
It's hard to forgive a man 
 Who bought revenge with his soul 
 A vein injected with 
 A man's life and his goals 
 It's in my face, it hurts 
 And I fall into a hollow sphere 
 Well, I don't want that 
 To happen to me 
 I don't want to see 
 What my face might be 
 Damn your shameful lies 
 As my conscience, it dies 
 Stop and listen as silence 
 Roars out in the night 
 One can't fake that anger and 
 Oh, it's shining so bright 
 Is this my fault 
 I will light it up to see 
 I will light it up 
 I don't really see 
 I don't want to be 
 Is this my fault? 
 I don't see inside of me 
 A moment turns to infinity 
 I don't want to see 
 What my face might be 
 Damn your shameful lies 
 As my conscience it dies 
 I just might hurt you, my friend 
 All that was left for me 
 Was destructive in misery 
 I blame you for all that I did 
 It's eating me bit by bit 
 How can all this be true 
 I blame it all on you 
 Electrocuted with a sense of loss 
 Anxiety will see me through 
 Flipping through the pages 
 Of a mind that hurts me 
 Sometimes I wish that I could 
 Eject from this seat 
 Of pain I'm fuckin' placed in 
 And let it go 
 You tell me what you think of me 
 And my sense of energetic rage 
 Compiled into a ball of anxiety 
 Do I need your help? 
 Do I need you?\
########### Mechanical Spin Phenomenon ###########
Blood on the walls 
 It embraces the fear that goes on in his mind as he cries out 
 Into the dark room he doesn't control 
 And don't see and don't choose to see his work 
 He won't hesitate for a minute to reach for everything he ever wanted 
 He could be that star, he could be the one 
 No complications when the game is won, he sees 
 City lights in an instant, he's going to light the night into a fire 
 As he turns them down with a pitiful look 
 Blessed nitroholic in a pickup truck, he burns 
 He burns 
 Stand or fall, anger says it all 
 Dance to his groove, moral on the move 
 Animal-like and he knows it 
 Still he covers it up when he shows it 
 He's got time to spare as he's turning it up 
 No hesitation as he's ready to drop, he screams 
 Undefined and somewhat normal 
 Still he's not aware he is mortal 
 He's got eyes that glow with a beautiful light 
 A mechanical spin roaring in the night, he burns 
 He burns 
 Blood on the walls 
 It embraces the fear that goes on in his mind as he cries out 
 Into the dark room he doesn't control 
 And don't see and don't choose to see his work 
 Fuel driven to expand 
 Memories burning in a mind-like tin can, it's hard to see 
 Mechanical addict, a drug of choice 
 Somatic/dynamic, it turns into an institution 
 It's hard to forgive blind perspective 
 Evolve to conceive machine of beauty 
 Veins bleedin' blood red, electrified 
 Human yet still bred, full automatic 
 Concept of mind 
 Anger grows in time 
 Dance to his groove 
 Moral on the move 
 Out of his mind for a minute 
 It seems like nobody is willing to let him spin it 
 With a pounding heart in a body of steel 
 The mechanical spin with a mind at the wheel 
 He sees the... 
 Blood on the walls 
 It embraces the fear that goes on in his mind as he cries out 
 Into the dark room he doesn't control 
 And don't see and don't choose to see his work

 Heading down the same old road

 You're bleeding 'cause of me 
 You're bleeding yourself 
 You'll pay the devil's fee 
 But the devil is me 
 The veins in my arm and 
 The veins in mine 
 Are on overload 
 They will explode 
 I will explode 
 Pushing the sticks 
 Right into myself 
 I've got no way 
 To control this 
 I need the pain 
 More than anything 
 I need to feel I'm alive 
 Pushing the sticks 
 Right into myself 
 I've got no way 
 To control this 
 I need the pain 
 More than anything 
 I need to feel I'm alive 
 So many times 
 I've taken the wrong road 
 And still I control you 
 The essence of revenge 
 Is not in you 
 It's in me and 
 I don't need it 
 I swear, if I go down 
 I'll take you with me 
 There's a blow 
 Right to your face 
 What a violent entry 
 Can you feel me 
 In your head 
 I know what you need 
 You need my pain and 
 Everything you lose 
 I seem to gain 
 I'll take it all 
 I will explode 
 I hurt you 'cause 
 I really need this 
 Pushing the sticks 
 Right into myself 
 I've got no way 
 To control this 
 I need the pain 
 More than anything 
 I need to feel I'm alive 
 Pushing the sticks 
 Right into myself 
 I've got no way 
 To control this 
 I need the pain 
 More than anything 
 I need to feel I'm alive
########### Deathbox ###########
I'm in a state of despair 
 Nothing seems to fit my mind 
 And although I can't be there 
 I still know that there's a place 
 For someone just like me 
 Now, will I ever wake up? 
 Wake up to see the box I'm in 
 And will I ever stand up 
 I'm standing on the edge of inability 
 And though I'm trying 
 It still penetrates my body 
 All these demons that 
 I carry deep inside 
 (Deep inside) 
 The changing faces 
 Forces me to leave the traces 
 Of the stranger things 
 That are growing in my mind 
 I know that I have 
 Done this once or twice before 
 The names are still a blur 
 I'm arrogantly close to 
 Falling off the edge 
 I know I'm not insane 
 Though my head hurts on the inside 
 The images disturb me 
 I know I'm not insane 
 I'm not what they call me 
 They are no good 
 Still surrounding me 
 Forcing my actions upon me 
 The blood just paints my world 
 They are no good 
 Still surrounding me 
 Forcing my actions upon me 
 They're forcing my 
 Actions upon my deathbox 
 And though I'm trying 
 It still penetrates my body 
 All these demons that 
 I carry deep inside 
 (Deep inside) 
 The changing faces 
 Forces me to leave the traces 
 Of the stranger things 
 That are growing in my mind 
 Now, will I ever wake up? 
 Wake up to see the box I'm in 
 And will I ever stand up 
 I'm standing on the edge of inability 
 Now, is this a failure 
 My project kill is right awake 
 I'm all burned out from pressure 
 My thoughts have brought me 
 To my knees, awake in pain 
 They are no good 
 Still surrounding me 
 Forcing my actions upon me 
 The blood just paints my world 
 They are no good 
 Still surrounding me 
 Forcing my actions upon me 
 They're forcing my 
 Actions upon my deathbox
########### Sane Vs. Normal ###########
Hello Mr. Richway 
 Welcome to the Sunset Hotel 
 Thank you, I'll fuckin' rape 
 And kill a girl, to quote myself 
 Needless to say, that this is a habit 
 I take it 'cause I can't have it 
 The bloody moves to grooves 
 That are the dance of death 
 Skin to barbed wire 
 In a final breath 
 I made the mistakes 
 I couldn't afford to make 
 Hell, they even knocked on my door 
 Because they found a girl dead in a lake 
 They won't catch me again 
 I've grown beyond my time and now 
 I moved beyond recognition 
 I clearly lost count 
 An escalation of schism 
 Still not sure why I do this 
 An overhelming urge 
 To reach a state of bliss? 
 I got it all pinned down and... 
 The hammer hit the nail 
 But I can't let them live 
 It's all too late for me 
 It's all too late for me 
 I hear them begging me 
 But I can't let them live 
 I can't let them live 
 Spill the blood and hide the bodies 
 Dead girls don't tell of my done deeds 
 Hell, they'll do it for money 
 I'll do them for free, I'm Mr. Richway 
 "Don't give a fuck what the bitch say" 
 I told you I got it all pinned down and now 
 They won't catch me again 
 I've grown beyond my time and now 
 The hammer hit the nail 
 But I can't let them live 
 It's all to late for me 
 It's all to late for me 
 I hear them begging me 
 But I can't let them live
########### Jack Vegas ###########
Flash my face 
 No intro needed 
 My self-awareness 
 Hasn't been mistreated 
 Ten times the fire 
 On a blackened sky 
 I won't break my back 
 A selfish try just to 
 Create my ideal picture 
 Sex is free and 
 My check's nine figures 
 The gold on my teeth 
 Draws the attention 
 Away from my suit 
 Pure velvet body suspension 
 You know who I am 
 Jack's the name 
 Style in a frame 
 My ego is fit and 
 My account the same 
 Shelby GT, black eyes 
 Behind shades 
 I get out of bed as the 
 Daylight fades on me 
 I will knock you out 
 By sheer appearance 
 Blinded by grace 
 You know me 
 Sharpened moves 
 To clear interference 
 You know my face 
 Yeah, you know me 
 You know 
 I feel your eyes on me 
 I know you're watching me 
 Who I am 
 I know it's hard to say 
 Want to be me in every way 
 There's nothing wrong 
 With the things I do 
 I only do them because 
 You want me to 
 Ignorant 
 The things I do despise 
 What you don't understand 
 I'm beyond life and you 
 I will knock you out 
 By sheer appearance 
 Blinded by grace 
 You know me 
 Sharpened moves 
 To clear interference 
 You know my face 
 Yeah, you know me
########### Mindsaver ###########
Save me from my mind 
 I never wanted to 
 Go down like this 
 Why don't you save me 
 Show me my options 
 That requires decisions 
 In an infinite line of 
 Reactions and visions 
 My good, my bad 
 My excellent choice 
 So innocent, my angry voice 
 The view of life 
 All clean from noise 
 My eyes lie 
 And when we're in 
 The locomotive 
 I don't know what to do 
 'Cause I still know 
 That I can't change 
 The lies that turn into truth 
 A part of you, a part of me 
 I don't know what to do 
 To realize the depth of life 
 It's just that 
 A flaming desire 
 For an innocent lust 
 Can change a lifetime 
 In a second of trust 
 Can change the future 
 It will turn out the light 
 We'll never know 
 If this was right 
 My eyes lie 
 Save me from my mind 
 (From my mind) 
 I never wanted to 
 Go down like this 
 Why don't you save me? 
 From what's inside of me 
 What's inside of me 
 It'll drive you mad if 
 You start to think 
 The ones who turned out 
 Would have never have met 
 The love of their life 
 In a life that they hate 
 The drunk driver that 
 Decided their fate 
 The dad of their child 
 Who's not so great 
 The emergency call too late 
 Eyes that meet and 
 Then look away 
 Gives birth to the thoughts 
 Of this inner decay 
 So action is taken 
 After dreams that are breaking 
 Are turning their back 
 To a mind that was faking 
 The things we do today 
 Will make tomorrow 
 Turn a different way 
 Completely blank 
 Nothing to say 
 My eyes lie 
 Save me from my mind 
 I never wanted to 
 Go down like this 
 Why don't you save me? 
 Save me from my mind 
 (From my mind) 
 I never wanted to 
 Go down like this 
 Why don't you save me? 
 From what's inside of me
########### Overdose In The Hall Of Fame ###########
I don't need to be like you 
 'Cause this place belongs to me 
 I'm far beyond the walls you see 
 My mind's ablaze and numb somehow 
 Sunrise as my mind, it sets 
 On finding ways to block that river 
 It flows with the blood that is life 
 I got my mind made up, I shiver 
 Electroshock these thoughts 
 Right through my brain 
 An obsession I can't kill 
 I don't want to kill my mind 
 It breathes, it feeds 
 I know it's doing well 
 (It's doing well) 
 The sacrifice will 
 Come soon enough 
 There's no evil 
 Underneath here 
 I don't need to be anything like you 
 'Cause this place belongs to me 
 I'm far beyond the walls you see 
 My mind's ablaze and numb somehow 
 Unlike things that I control 
 I don't want to kill my feelings 
 I know you want me to 
 Get in line 
 And submit to your intentions 
 I don't need to be anything like you 
 'Cause this place belongs to me 
 I'm far beyond the walls you see 
 My mind's ablaze and numb somehow 
 I don't need to be like you 
 'Cause this place belongs to me

########### The Silver Drop ###########
Penetrate my will to speak, this feeling just won't go away 
 Straight line through my soul and feel my inability to stop this today 
 Hardline the drug of affection, at least I know how to hurt it to perfection 
 The silver drop gets under my skin, my skin 
 I wake up, now I'm alone again 
 I've been here, I didn't like it then 
 I bleed, 'cause this is what I am 
 My last shot, now make me twice the man 
 This is what I am 
 And I know my time will come 
 My time to cross the nation 
 With screams of insane heresy 
 I label minds in frustration 
 Come on and lead me into the light 
 Twenty reasons to guide me 
 I need a reason to stand up and fight 
 Need to believe what I see 
 The stars are shining upon me tonight 
 I need my wishes to come true 
 But though the cure I need is in sight 
 I'll never make it through 
 I wake up, now I'm alone again 
 I've been here, I didn't like it then 
 I bleed, 'cause this is what I am 
 My last shot, now make me twice the man 
 This is what I am 
 Reason is only a matter of opinion 
 Control is only an illusion to spit on 
 Bring my coffee, a truth to lean on 
 My silence is bought and my beliefs are all gone 
 Innocent as a new born child 
 No need to point your fingers 
 I never did the things you say 
 I never hurt no one in anyway so... 
 Come on and lead me into the light 
 Twenty reasons to guide me 
 I need a reason to stand up and fight 
 Need to believe what I see 
 The stars are shining upon me tonight 
 I need my wishes to come true 
 But though the cure I need is in sight 
 I'll never make it through 
 And I know that they don't want me 
 And I see that it's beyond me 
 I wake up, now I'm alone again 
 I've been here, I didn't like it then 
 I bleed, 'cause this is what I am 
 My last shot, now make me twice the man 
 This is what I am

Wild boys 
 Wild boys 
 Wild boys 
 The wild boys are calling 
 On their way back from the fire 
 In August moon's surrender to 
 A dust cloud on the rise 
 Wild boys fallen, far from glory 
 Reckless and so hungered 
 On the razor's edge you trail 
 Because there's murder 
 By the roadside 
 In a sore, afraid new world 
 They tried to break us looks 
 Like they'll try again 
 Wild boys, never lose it 
 Wild boys, never chose this way 
 Wild boys, never close your eyes 
 Wild boys always shine 
 You got sirens for their welcome 
 There's bloodstain for your pain 
 And your telephone been ringing 
 While you're dancing in the rain 
 Wild boys wonder, where is glory 
 Where is all you angels 
 Now the figureheads have fell 
 And lovers war with arrows 
 Over secrets they could tell 
 They tried to tame you 
 Like they'll try again 
 Wild boys, never lose it 
 Wild boys, never chose this way 
 Wild boys, never close your eyes 
 Wild boys always shine 
 Wild boys, never lose it

Chaos 
 The beating of my heart 
 The silence unbroken by this vast darkness 
 That is me, the explorer 
 The soul in me burning bright 
 That is me, the voyager 
 Spoken words by me, the passenger 
 I have travelled to the infinite 
 That is me, the blind visitor 
 Can anyone hear me?

In the nothingness black! 
 A harmonious whole 
 Everything is a repetitive pattern 
 Blocks of time to fit the puzzle 
 Leading to question without answer 
 I a harmonious half 
 Awaiting death through the hourglass 
 Burning colour off the soul 
 No character no recognition factor 
 The hourglass keeps turning but still 
 Without no sand running 
 Rustborn not in reason nor in prose 
 But in doubt of the damn mirror ghost 
 Awaken back in truth 
 In the nothingness 
 Awaken back in truth

 Black ocean 
 Awaken back in truth 
 Awaken back in.. TRUTH 
 Walk upon this earth, 
 We all are worms 
 Quenching hearts,

 We might find something, 
 If we look close 
 I want to tear my skin, 
 I want to tear your skin 
 Spread your wings like the lies 
 Awaken back in truth

 The chief messenger 
 I remain outside heavenly curtain 
 As of now, no one is calling me 
 Devil and this is no act of god

 Back in the truth 
 Awaken back in truth

 The liquid from their minds

 It has abandoned the world and left us alone 
 Falling into oblivion 
 Never quite reaching bottom 
 No point of collision 
 Only cold striving the perception

 Lets all gather there

 Come on, let's waste it away

 Travelling like a dry ocean 
 Without eyes, without ears 
 Let's all gather here

 Tonight straight to the head 
 Death is where the heart is 
 Born without a face

 Of causing darkness

 Wasn't meant to be a part of me but still 
 You always touch me 
 You always find me 
 Where the hell could I hide from you 
 Raping my memories 
 Raping what I am doing with devotion 
 Raping my damn memories 
 Raping what I am with such a devotion 
 Don't play your dirty tricks on me 
 I'll find the key of that cage you placed me in 
 Don't play tricks on me now 
 I never meant to be this way 
 I could not run away 
 I won't let you dig inside myself any longer 
 Surrounded in every corner 
 Dragging me down in paranoia you left me 
 Emotional nothingness remains there 
 Then nothing more i can feel stuck here with my self 
 I never meant to be this way 
 I could not run away 
 Dragging me down! 
 Dragging me down! 
 Can anything happen then in this suffering you left me 
 I'm stuck here 
 Don't come around anymore 
 I got the key to make you go away 
 But I got the key to hold you inside of me 
 Can anything happen then in this suffering you left me 
 I'm stuck here 
 Don't come around anymore

There's nowhere to go 
 There's nothing to see

 Where is my love 
 Where is my love!!? 
 So many venomous tongues, all around me

 And crawl through my gaze 
 No more, 
 no fucking more, 
 no fucking more, no 
 The gathering of 
 Rusted halos in hope of finding 
 The right answers 
 The right answers 
 Peal off the aged skin of the soul 
 Off the soul 
 Emancipate in darkness 
 And be reborn 
 I need you to save me 
 Cause I am fear from deliverance 
 Yeah, I am fear from deliverance 
 Yeah cause I am far from deliverance 
 I'm crawling, but living 
 Travelling out of time 
 I'm crawling, but living 
 Travelling out of time 
 (Out of time) 
 Here we go, I am a supernaut 
 I go to space and back 
 And I feel comfortably lost 
 What a shapeless and formless 
 Aggregate of escape 
 Why my heart feels so bad 
 I need you to save me 
 Cause I am far from deliverance 
 Yeah, I am far from deliverance 
 Yeah, cause I am far from deliverance 
 I'm crawling, but living

 See how long you can hold you breath now 
 Let me see, determine wrong from right - you're forced 
 Into a shaking world - you're plunged 
 See me interfere, watch me being your fear, feel me interfere

 Coming closer when refusing what I am 
 I'm with you 
 I'm with you, you'd better learn to deal with me 
 Coming closer when refusing what I am

 Leave your fears away 
 Before your heart stand still 
 Leave your fears away, away 
 Fear will touch you anyway 
 Before you're connected, in touch, before becoming one of them 
 Remember you were about to cut the links 
 As you were about to get out, you suddenly asked for more 
 I, I have an eye on your back, so 
 No need to run against me, don't fight against me, you 
 You don't want me to be close anymore 
 Not anymore, you get bored, before becoming one of them 
 Remember you weer about to cut the links 
 Before you're connected, before becoming one of those that failed 
 I'm with you, you'd better learn to deal with me 
 Coming closer when refusing what I am 
 I'm with you 
 I'm with you, you'd better learn to deal with me 
 Coming closer when refusing what I am 
 I come along with you, 
 Before your heart stand still 
 And leaves you breathless 
 Leave your fears away 
 Before your heart stand still, leave your fears away 
 Before your heart stand still 
 Leave your fears away, before your heart stand still 
 Leave your fears away
########### Sons Of The System ###########
I drift and fall in space 
 I twist like a vermin in deformed shapes 
 Eyes turn to black 
 Fear is your god 
 I'm just a shadow lost in space 
 Oh, I'm fading in motion 
 Into the system 
 We are the sons of the system 
 We rise and fall 
 We'll make the corrupted bleed for our existence 
 Nothing to fear, only what you can hear 
 We are the sons of the system 
 We rise and fall 
 The wind of enslavement is blowing 
 The pulse of extinction arising 
 These are the sounds of sorrow 
 These are the cries of the sons of tomorrow 
 Fear is god into the system 
 We are the sons of the system 
 We rise and fall 
 Will we rise 
 Will we fall
########### Diesel Uterus ###########
Adrenaline rising, twisting and crawling 
 Implanted inside, this chemical imbalance turns us to lifeless puppets 
 March in hordes, assembled as components for the new world 
 Screenlines dancing in our eyes 
 Our lives, dying in our arms 
 Senses bypassed by this corruption 
 We're all born in a diesel uterus 
 This chemical imbalance is telling me there is no end 
 A digital venom strangling the world 
 Screenlines dancing in our eyes 
 Our lives, dying in our arms 
 Screenlines dancing in our eyes 
 Our lives, dying in our arms 
 My dreams, my beliefs, dictated 
 Read your revelation from this scorched earth 
 Pray for your new god 
 Salvation is only a word

 Our lives dying in our arms 
 Screenlines dancing in our eyes 
 Our lives dying in our arms

Give it to me 
 Shout it to me 
 You just pathetic piece of truth 
 Will I ever be the same 
 Who will be the one to blame 
 Will I ever be the same 
 You will be the one to blame 
 You will be the one to blame 
 Through years of sorrow 
 The humans that we are 
 Are crawling down below 
 We are slaves to ourselves 
 Slaves to ourselves 
 Will we ever be the same 
 Will we ever be the same 
 We're sick 
 Sick of fighting everyday 
 Sick of lying everyday 
 Sick of dying anyway 
 Sick of all 
 Blinded by storms around you 
 You need an earthquake to wake you up 
 Before the light is gone 
 Before your life is gone 
 Leave aside the colossal hypocrisy 
 The general hypocrisy 
 Rent yourself an opinion 
 Rent yourself an opinion 
 We're sick 
 Sick of fighting everyday 
 Sick of lying everyday 
 Sick of dying anyway 
 We're sick... 
 We're sick of fighting everyday 
 We're sick of dying anyway 
 We're sick of all 
 You will be the one to blame 
 You will be the one to blame 
 Back in the old days 
 Programmed to live your life superior 
 But now your life is gone 
 But now the light is gone 
 We're still sick 
 Sick of fighting everyday 
 Sick of lying everyday 
 Sick of dying anyway 
 We're sick 
 Sick of fighting everyday 
 Sick of lying everyday 
 Sick of dying anyway 
 Sick of all
########### The Erasing ###########
It's been a while 
 We've lost the human poetry 
 The future no longer shines 
 The cancer is growing 
 We're both 
 A piece of death 
 A piece of life 
 But can we cancel the erasing? 
 Replacing 
 We're faking 
 Falling off the chair again 
 I came here to warn you 
 This future no longer shines 
 We are hypocrisy 
 We are so wasteful 
 We are a fantasy 
 (We are) 
 But can we cancel the erasing? 
 Replacing 
 We're faking 
 Falling off the chair again 
 Falling off the chair again 
 We're both 
 A piece of death

 Replacing 
 We're faking 
 Falling off the chair again 
 Replacing 
 We're faking 
 Falling off the chair again 
 Falling off the chair again...

Take a walk 
 Take the last step 
 Towards the end 
 On the backbone of night 
 These might be the last steps we set 
 As we climb to the stars (to the stars) 
 As we climb to the stars 
 Towards the end 
 A depressive earth 
 With a depressive shape 
 They will tear holes into the ground 
 Then we will watch the world burn down (the world burn down) 
 The world burn down 
 It seems today 
 Has come for me 
 Please god 
 Come save me 
 Take a walk 
 Take a step forward 
 And don't look back

########### March Of The Tripods ###########
Do you feel the machines coming? 
 Do you feel the storm rising? 
 Because they're coming 
 I feel them rising 
 It feels like it's about to happen 
 I can breathe the smell of blades of steel 
 I can see their light but it's not that clear 
 Because they're watching 
 I feel them staring 
 I feel them staring at us 
 It feels like it's about to happen 
 Change is about to happen 
 It feels more like I am dying 
 This black hole leaving me hopeless 
 Leaving me hopeless 
 I'm not made of wires 
 I'm not made of others 
 You try to synchronize me 
 You try to synchronize me 
 The locust is just too far away 
 While marching the tripods 
 Now I'm made of wires 
 Now I'm made of others 
 Now I'm made of wires 
 Did you feel the machines coming? 
 Did you feel the storm rising? 
 Because now they're reigning 
 We're suffocating 
 And it feels like it starts to happen 
 It starts to happen
########### Fate ###########
You think you teach me 
 How to intensify myself 
 You'd better watch me 
 Throwing all the pressure away 
 You should have taught me 
 How to hypnotize my faith 
 You'd better watch me 
 Throwing all the pressure away 
 Day after day 
 It's just the same old song 
 I'm fading away 
 Will I get old 
 Will I get old 
 I will get old 
 You should have taught me 
 To wipe your own dirt to blind me 
 You should have watched me 
 Smashing your face up along my way 
 You shouldn't have told me 
 How to liquify my fate 
 You should have watched me 
 Will I get old 
 Will I get old 
 But through your eyes again 
 Some of us will stare 
 You think you teach me 
 You think you know me 
 You think you watch me 
 You think you know me 
 Will I get old 
 Will I get old 
 But through your eyes again 
 Some of us will stare 
 Through your eyes again 
 Some of us will stare...

 With fake words 
 More than just a fear 
 Filling you up with angry tears 
 More than just a need 
 Dying again and living again everyday 
 On the edge we stand

Spiritual sickness spreads in me 
 Plan out the future until you know what there will be 
 Until you know what there will be 
 (When the dust) 
 When the dust settles 
 You've become free 
 The fire inside feels like it's about to burst 
 Everything seems to much, I don't feel at home 
 I feel so goddamn empty, everey day is eating a piece away 
 Until there is no more left of me 
 Until there is no more left of me 
 Elongated sporadic bursts 
 Until there is no more left of me 
 Leaving my body cold 
 Calculating a new apocalypse 
 Thread the result to create your world 
 No one hears the voice of sanity in this Maelstrom

########### Orbiting ###########
No anger. 
 No pity. 
 My god, 
 No fear! 
 Orbiting my thoughts around this world 
 I get to the point where I have to abandon all hope 
 So far where no one hears me now 
 No one hears me now 
 I only see the blood falling down 
 I get the feeling this will never happen 
 Barbed wire, wrapped around my face 
 Wrapped around my face 
 Orbiting in dark matter 
 Even death could be better 
 No one hears me now 
 See the blood falling down 
 I get to the point where I have to abandon it all 
 No one hears me anymore 
 Keep your head looking towards the sky 
 Towards the sky 
 Towards the sky 
 See the blood falling down, coming down 
 Man has gone where no one else has gone before 
 Man has gone where no one else has been before 
 I only see the blood falling down 
 I get the feeling this will never happen 
 Barbed wire, wrapped around my face 
 Wrapped around my face 
 No one hears me now 
 See the blood falling down 
 Down 
 Orbiting in dark matter 
 Even death could be better 
 Could be better...
########### Transcend ###########
Holes in the fabric of the soul 
 Like whispers from a rotting corpse 
 The cancer of your carelessness 
 Swimming so treacherous 
 The falling motionless into venture 
 If only I could transcend away 
 Into a place where all emotions fade away 
 Escape from an animated system of imperfections 
 The world runs empty of ways 
 I'm swimming through this nightmare 
 Where black waves pull me under 
 Black is the fuel running through this membrane 
 Frozen corpse eyes starring blind 
 Only smiling faces trapped in the grave 
 How long before this silence fades 
 I'm swimming through this nightmare 
 Where black waves pull me under 
 In another place where memories will fade 
 Choking underneath these waves 
 Why have you forsaken me 
 I can't see any future anymore 
 If I could just transcend away 
 Into a place where all emotions will fade 
 Transcend 
 Transcend 
 I'm swimming through this nightmare 
 Where black waves pull me under
########### Valves ###########
The stench of poison in the heat reflects 
 My sweet crystal myth 
 One day bleeds into the next 
 Into the next 
 When will the corrosion of emotion 
 Will happen this time 
 Can you feel it dropping? 
 In the depths of a comet's stomach 
 I travel with this hollow vessel 
 Spirals and shadows dancing in front 
 I relapse and inhale the dust 
 Well it's all just an organic illusion 
 You know what makes us breathe 
 Makes our heart beat 
 In the valve of the heart 
 You know it makes me bleed 
 I just meant you're alive 
 Spirals and shadows dancing in front 
 I relapse and inhale the dust 
 Somewhere somehow 
 Somewhere somehow 
 Spirals and shadows dancing in front 
 I relapse and inhale the dust
########### Junkies On The Storm ###########
Dark spatter across the ocean 
 Violent craving a revelation 
 Who would have thought you would get this far 
 So far & completely lost 
 So far 
 With nothing to hold on 
 This battle, which I fight all alone 
 Can't let go 
 It's not there anymore 
 When everyone tells me to come home 
 I say hey 
 I'm just gone riding the storm 
 Please hear me now 
 Oh would you please hear my words 
 Hear this 
 Please hear me now 
 Oh would you please hear my words 
 I need that beacon 
 I need this storm 
 Your words spoken 
 I've already said 
 I've surfed these circles before 
 Never have I been so close 
 To losing myself in this storm 
 Twisting out of control 
 Will I ever let go? 
 I am just a junkie on the storm 
 Please hear me now 
 Oh would you please hear my words 
 Hear this 
 Please hear me now 
 Oh would you please hear my words 
 I need that beacon 
 I need this 
 That beacon in the storm 
 I need that beacon 
 I need this storm
########### I've Been You ###########
This sight is no longer yours 
 Blinded you have been 
 Slowly crawling in my veins 
 A vicious disaster implanted in me 
 I've been you 
 Since day one 
 A compromise till the end of time 
 I've been you 
 Since day one 
 A compromise till the end of time 
 Shattering the glass that used to set me 
 From darkness to reality 
 I've been you 
 Since day one 
 A compromise till the end of time 
 I've been you 
 Since day one 
 A compromise till the end of time 
 This is humanity, a fake morality 
 My head is ocean 
 My head is mountain 
 It's an overwhelming sight 
 It's an overwhelming fake pride 
 It's so overwhelming 
 Overwhelming sight 
 I've been blind 
 I've been sick 
 I've been blinded 
 I've been stupid
########### Pattern Platform ###########
I am not myself any fucking more 
 Smooth caresses on my ribs 
 Freezing and boiling 
 Thrown out of my schedule 
 Despite we tried to get it magnified 
 We'll never 
 Surrender 
 Reverberating the sense of life 
 From a butterfly to a bitter end 
 Into a whole new down 
 Like the world was never meant to be 
 It's just a senseless pattern 
 Into a whole new down 
 In this pattern we drown 
 Inside it's just a war 
 Will it ever end 
 The sacrifice of inner fuck 
 From a butterfly to a bitter end 
 It feels like I am gone 
 It feels like I am not the same anymore 
 It feels like I am gone 
 It feels like I am gone 
 Into this pattern we drown 
 Into a whole new down 
 Like the world was never meant to be 
 It's just a senseless pattern 
 Into a whole new down 
 In this pattern we drown

 This is the Mnemesis 
 A third eye opening 
 Coming from one direction 
 Breathing neon, yeah 
 Hidden layers of reality unfold 
 Indulgent of pleasures and frustration 
 I see it 
 I breathe it 
 Can't you see 
 This is the Mnemesis 
 This is the Mnemesis 
 The wind that blasts from the sun 
 The rays that never show 
 Encapsulated in a sphere of skin 
 Of skin 
 I see it 
 I breathe it 
 Can't you see 
 This is the Mnemesis 
 This is the Mnemesis 
 An invisible boundary to be seen 
 Absorption of senses and time 
 Letters fade to black as the Mnemesis arrives 
 The Mnemesis arrives 
 I see it 
 I breathe it 
 Can't you see 
 This is the Mnemesis 
 Truth erased from the book of life 
 Pages ripped and torn apart 
 Slithering arms of venom 
 Stretch and unfold 
 Through the heart 
 I feel the texture through your fingertips 
 Taste the letters, yeah 
 A self deprecation unfolded 
 We burn the air and breathe 
 I see it 
 I breathe it 
 Can't you see 
 This is the Mnemesis 
 I see it

 Can't you see

 Despite we know it all 
 Despite we know it all

 We let it go 
 Like we always need a purpose 
 We always need a little distance 
 I won't give it away 
 I won't give it away 
 Perpetually catching up with who we are 
 Just a state of mind 
 Will you give it away 
 Will you give it away 
 Like there's no tomorrow 
 Despite we know it all 
 Despite we know it all 
 Despite we know it all 
 We let it go
########### Haven At The End Of The World ###########
When you feel so lost 
 And there's nothing to hold on 
 Lost in a golden trap 
 Just another ritual absurd 
 A single life time 
 Is all we need 
 A single life time 
 Is not enough 
 It's just a fucked up world 
 Into another fucked up world 
 See you at the end of it 
 This world as we know it 
 Your soul 
 Washes up on these shores 
 Your soul 
 (You) suffocate on these shores 
 Like the time glass you can't turn 
 Like the weight of the universe 
 Like the time glass you can't turn 
 Like the weight of the universe 
 Attached to a led cross 
 At the end of the road 
 In silence 
 A single life time 
 Is not enough 
 Your soul 
 Washes up on these shores 
 Your soul 
 (You) suffocate on these shores 
 Your soul 
 Washes up on these shores

 A single lifetime is not enough 
 Not enough

Empty of sand and stones 
 We're tuned to the key of insanity 
 Steps taken with broken feet

 This real fake lie is true 
 It's such a war within our souls 
 These faces are all dead for me 
 Cause it's all fucked up 
 Can't feel it slowly fading 
 Can you feel it 
 You've got to feel it 
 And every time I close my eyes 
 Just an ocean of void I see 
 Just an ocean of void I see 
 Will I have to say it again 
 This real fake lie is true 
 It's such a war within our souls 
 Our souls 
 The water is providence 
 We forget it's providence 
 The fire is providence 
 Can't feel it slowly fading 
 Can you feel it 
 You've got to feel 
 And every time I close my eyes 
 Just an ocean of void I see 
 I see 
 Oh yeah 
 Imperious thirst of a past once desired 
 Still embracing it till the end of the earth 
 Still embracing it till the end of the earth 
 We're losing ourselves 
 Can't feel it slowly fading 
 Can you feel it 
 You've got to feel it 
 And every time I close my eyes 
 Just an ocean of void I see

Hammered through hands and feet 
 Rusted nails of deceit 
 Devoured by your disease 
 Watch the animal bleed 
 Just watch us bleeding 
 By the mouth covered with blisters 
 From my goddamn saint 
 20,000 lies underneath your soul 
 Is where it all ends 
 50,000 lies underneath your soul 
 In this dark desert where it all ends 
 Black rotten tongue smearing 
 Like a slithering snake 
 No way to plead the fifth 
 No way to plead the fifth 
 A journey to the center of my wound 
 20,000 lies underneath your soul 
 Is where it all ends 
 50,000 lies underneath your soul 
 In this dark desert where it all ends 
 Where it all ends 
 Where it all ends 
 Where it all ends

########### 1. Ghost (Radio Edit) ###########
I made you and your hate to socialize in a matter that suits me fine. 
 So while I breathe in you punched my teeth in. 
 I tried to explain it but you just, you just don't see. 
 I, I see right through you. 
 So you do things, mainly bad things. Is it to satisfy your own neurotic needs. 
 I got this feeling I'm just dreaming but just make sure I'm awake when you punish me. 
 Come follow me to that place where we both see what happened to you. I need 
 To see if it's all true. Confide in me. 
 I was blind but now... 
 I see right through all that you do, but though I see you I know you're not 
 Here with me and still I try to explain to you. 
 How your presence is affecting my state of mind. 
 [CHOR.] 
 Oh suck me in, inside myself 
 I want to, taste myself 
 It drags me down, your dismal past 
 And all you want, is to make that last 
 [CHOR.] 
 Don't want this, its true what they say 
 Ignorance is bliss, I'll find another way 
 In my mind, it's all good now 
 I don't do things, that's abnormal 
 They'll take me and put me away. 
 Listen to me when I tell you I'm not insane 
 I, I see right through you
########### Bloodstained ###########
Did you not make me take the blame for you 
 Did you not take me for a fool and then you made me cry 
 What did you achieve, blood/hate I believe 
 Watch as I deceive you in hell 
 So you lived your life on a level of indiscretion which I've never seen 
 Your ignorance makes my silent anger just wake up and scream 
 It's bloodstained. 
 So in all this hate, the suffering, it makes me go insane 
 Twistin? and turning to avoid the burning that is this pain 
 [CHOR.] 
 So you would like me to go down 
 Face it I won't let you win this game 
 So you spit in my face 
 Still I get up and scream 
 Is that all that you got, I got more for you 
 Your past will catch up with you, so why not take a chance now 
 So you blame it all on the use and abuse of your sad power 
 But I'm sad to hear your arrogant excuses as I break you in your finest hour 
 So I say did you not fuck it up, did you pay when your greed just wouldn't stop 
 All that time did you ever think of me 
 But in time I will make you understand, Ironically I will make you understand 
 You will violently learn to know my name.

He's been told that he can't do wrong to a lonely child that cries in his 
 Song to understand the mans depravation but to him an invitation......so 
 He came in, the child turned its head and its a sin how his eyes looked all dead then. 
 What he saw, the fear on his face could wait no more. Heart-stabbed and disgraced 
 Double crossed 
 That's a double cross, backstabbin? doublecross, heart stabbin? doublecross, 
 His pain and his loss 
 In his eyes was the recognition of a nasty face whose hurt and mission has 
 Fucked a life of bodily prison. 
 It's consequence of a sick mans vision...he 
 Made a move, the gun went off and he changed the mood into blood coloured madness. 
 All he saw was the shadow of a grown man n? flesh was raw as he fell down again. 
 [CHOR.] 
 All he ever wanted to be was that man 
 Did he ever stand up and see for himself 
 Never wanted that intimacy, nor that fear 
 If he would only reach out to me I'd show him life 
 And that I can't stand you make me sick 
 Have you seen the tears that the boy cries 
 Have you seen the pain that he wears inside 
 So alive, the pain ensures that he really feels like a part of the damned. 
 Such a bitch, joy and smile are long gone, its just hate in small child rape land...he's 
 All locked up in a room with his devil it's all fucked up. 
 He's going down in pure revenge, so he saw how his best friend helped him 
 Study and the score: justice done, a dead body 
 Wont you wait for him, wont you wait for him 
 They took all he had, what's left is all in his head.

########### Hero (In) ###########
More than just a need 
 It fills you up with dark secrets 
 More than just a dream 
 Plunging yourself in a fake world 
 In a fake world 
 With fake words 
 More than just a fear 
 Filling you up with angry tears 
 More than just a need 
 Dying again and living again everyday 
 On the edge we stand 
 On the edge we stand 
 Alone once again 
 All my feelings are fading away 
 This soul domination 
 Is taking you away 
 Physical domination 
 But still you beg for more 
 But still you beg for 
 More than just a fear 
 Filling you up with angry tears 
 More than just a need 
 Dying again and living again everyday 
 On the edge we stand 
 On the edge we stand 
 Alone once again 
 All my feelings are fading away

 Alone once again 
 All my feelings are fading away 
 More than just a need 
 More than just a dream 
 More than just a fear 
 More than all 
 On the edge we stand

 Alone once again 
 All my feelings are fading away 
 On the edge we stand 
 On the edge we stand 
 Alone once again 
 All my feelings are fading away 
 Are just fading away

########### Hollow ###########
I never forgot the time I lost faith in this a lost journey of many years, my 
 Heart has been torn in twain but still I stand and here I shall remain, with a 
 Feeble mind and a sea of lies dragging me to the depths of false beliefs, I 
 Seek the answer, the search will consume me until I sleep and perhaps dream of 
 Such a reality. shame lurks within my soul, in my tortured dreams, but I'm free 
 From the shackles of ignorance, right now! I am free! I am drowning in 
 Unhallowed waters, merely a hollow vessel of existence, merely a vessel of 
 Existence. looking through faithless eyes, am I afraid to die? are you afraid 
 To die? I will remember, when the skies are clear, I will remember, when my 
 Death is near, will you remember, the faith I had in you? will you remember? 
 When my time has come.
########### Keymaker ###########
Our secrets are laid bare before my eyes its I and I alone who can grant 
 Passage to our most inner circle. who can judge the weak from the strong? the 
 Truth from the falsehood the sacred record of our unforgiving past and of the 
 Torturous road we have trodden, I alone bare these burdens on my shoulders sit 
 Sins of the angels, I alone know the names of those who've fallen from grace. I 
 Cannot rest whilst they still remain to stain our our, I'm the master, your the 
 Puppet that dances to my tune. our secrets are laid bare before my eyes its I 
 And I alone who can grant passage to our most inner circle. and you shall taste 
 The undreamed joys that lie beyond the bounds of a mortal sense.
########### Set In Stone ###########
Words from a distant past 
 Echo throughout my mind! 
 Changing me, destroying me. 
 Whispers of the dead pull me under 
 And they have been doing so for so long, 
 They have been doing so. 
 I have come from hell with sins stained 
 Clearly within my skin 
 But know I rest absolved, 
 Stand in light without fear. 
 Theyd like to think our fate is set in stone, 
 But I will build my own path, with these hands. 
 The words of the wise will be forever carved into my skin 
 Unless I make something of these last breaths. 
 Words from a distant past echo throughout my mind. 
 Changing me, destroying me. 
 And now I have these wings I must fly straight 
 And not surrender to demons chasing me. 
 My fate my destiny I hold to these like I do my life, 
 I am the architect of my fate.
########### All Seeing Eye ###########
Nothing but a memory its now not then that I treasure a glimpse of the past 
 Returned to me through the eyes of the innocent. they don't care so why should I!? 
 It when you feel safe that you forget about the future, well its about time 
 I ripped you out of that suspended moment. throw you out into the cold. to let 
 The people speak their minds. voices of reflections help me carry on and 
 Remember what its like to be alive, this wont be the end of me. nothing but a 
 Memory its now not then that I treasure a glimpse of the past returned to me 
 Through the eyes of the innocent.
########### Metamorphosis ###########
I've lived life drained, void of emotion. 
 I've lived life drained. 
 I will never become this again. 
 I will rise over this. 
 Smash through obstacles with a heart of gold and a mind of steel; 
 Nothing will stand in my path. 
 I've been consumed by my thoughts. 
 I've become what I've always despised. 
 The only way I can absolve myself is with your lies. 
 I've been pushed to the edge, 
 Where my mind knows no bounds. 
 Never again. 
 My mind has released itself from this anguish and I will overcome this suffering. 
 I will be whole once again... I will be whole once again. 
 And I will become the answers to my own prayers, 
 And I won't let you bring me down. 
 I will remain! 
 Nothing you say can take this heart away from me.
########### The Deadmines ###########
God has left this place a long time ago but I still remain here until the 
 Bitter end I will never give up this world enthralled by hatred which swarms 
 And consumes this fragile society and when you think I'm done ill remain dead 
 Inside you ill come back to haunt you, your so torn. I will rule this place ill 
 Burn it to the ground I will rise from these ashes just to bring it all down 
 Again! welcome to my wasteland! in the end it wont mean anything your presence 
 Taints the air we breathe you fucking hide behind your numbers you return our 
 Streets to sand you shall wither away where you stand shall wither away you 
 Will drown in what you've created your false gods wont help you now, your fears 
 Seep through the cracks in our walls destroying you rats from the inside, your 
 Fears seep through the cracks in our walls, destroying you rats from the inside out!
########### Dispossession ###########
Lost in a valley of smoke, I lose sight of those I love 
 I can't live in this dream, wondering the world a lost soul 
 A shell of a man, frozen in a toxic trance 
 A shell of a man, frozen in a toxic trance 
 Unfamiliar reflection stare at me, these eye are not my own 
 Running from my demons in this endless valley 
 Show me the way, because I no longer know right from wrong 
 I know what has to be done, the smoke will settle the demons will come and I will be torn apart 
 Exposing my weakness the world will see, what I never, what I never, fucking wanted 
 As I stare at your face, soaked in disgrace, what is the price a judgment of life, I cry out in this dispossession 
 Exposing my weakness the world will see what I never, what I never, what I never fucking 
 Wanted 
 They crowd around me, here to take their share of my mind 
 I can no longer muster the strength to face them alone, all on my own 
 They whisper echoes in unknown tongues, I refuse to absorb their toxic words 
 I've forgotten how to love, searching behind locked doors in my mind 
 They whisper echoes in unknown tongues, I refuse to absorb their toxic words 
 I've forgotten how to love, searching behind locked doors in my mind 
 Cast aside the fear of reality, face the fucking world 
 Cast aside the fear of reality, face the fucking world
########### Abrasumente ###########
Remake, reform the consciousness 
 Let the light bleed out of your eyes and mouth 
 Seek the answers to the question that constrain your mind to this futile dimesion 
 We are the severed minds disconnected from the masses, a world of free thinkers 
 We are longing for an understanding of the universe around us when we barely understand the universe within our minds 
 Free your mind 
 Who will answer the call when it comes from within? 
 Who will answer the call? 
 I stand before you baring a flood of change 
 I stand before you to undo and rearrange 
 Remove the blind fold, realize the lies told and see the world with new eyes 
 Abra su mente a la realidad 
 Abra su mente a la realidad 
 We are the severed minds disconnected from the masses a world of free thinkers 
 We are the severed minds disconnected from the masses a world of free thinkers 
 So take this life and hold it for it's about to change, bleed out the coursing veins 
 Who will answer the call when it comes from within?
########### Comatose ###########
I'll let the silence speak for me 
 The words are like stars unimaginable in my sky 
 I can see what the eyes cannot see 
 I cann hear what the ears cannot hear 
 I can feel what the heart and mind cannot feel 
 I am imagination 
 What if dreams were reality? 
 We could reap a world we've sewn 
 Lost in imagination 
 Lost in a world that is not your own 
 Watching my world crumble away while I'm searching for meaning and purpose in this life 
 Flourished in knowledge and gifted with a pure existence 
 I can see what the eyes cannot see 
 I can hear what the ears cannot hear 
 I've given myself a reason to live for 
 On my own, 
 I've given myself something to live for 
 On my fucking own 
 On my own 
 Upon this desolate rock 
 I cast my soul into the sky, into the sky liberating myself and opening my mind to the universe 
 Liberating myself and opening my mind to the universe 
 Together we will shine a light like stars, burning through the dark 
 Together we will shine a light like stars, burning through the dark 
 Together we will shine a light like stars, burning through the dark 
 Through the dark
########### Transcending Dimensions ###########
All my life I've been searching for something to put my faith into to give my life to you 
 And I will love you in this world and if there's a next 
 And I will love you in this world and if there's a next 
 Among the chaos of this world and the overwhelming tide of responsibility 
 I remember how long it's been since I've felt warmth within my heart 
 A cold world where love would transcend this dimension 
 A continuous source of inspiration 
 And I've been waiting for all of my, all my life 
 I've been searching for something to put my faith into to give my life to you 
 And I will love you in this world and if there's a next 
 All I want is to remember what it's like to love again. 
 This blistering cold, I've grown so fond of left me in a heartless state 
 And after all these years I've finally realised that maybe I was never meant to love, or be loved 
 And if you want to run away I can take you there 
 I can take you somewhere beautiful and it can be our world 
 And if you want to run away I can take you there 
 I can take you somewhere beautiful and it can be our world
########### Corruption ###########
I opened my eyes to the world day after day I searched for answers 
 As time went by I grew further away from who I was 
 I felt lost chasing a ghost I might never find, but what I found I wasn't prepared for 
 Everywhere I look I see crime without punishment; I just didn't know where to begin 
 I am holding onto what bit of sanity I have left 
 I am holding onto what bit of sanity I have left 
 Come fight with me my brothers, and claim our world that's been violated by the hands of the corrupt 
 I am but one, but together we hold the key to a new dawn of prosperity 
 We've created a seed that has spread to the core of humanity 
 Killing itself from the inside 
 Unintentional suicide 
 Unintentional suicide 
 Unintentional suicide 
 Money and corruption ruin the land 
 Crooked politicians betray the working man, pocketing the profits, treating us like sheep 
 We're tired of hearing promises we know they'll never keep 
 I will become the end of this sad and bleak corruption that reigns on all
########### Exposure ###########
I'll tear the memories out of my subconscious and piece together where I went wrong 
 Sewn together with the strands of lament I'll cloak myself in a veil of remorse and regret, that keep me bound to a world that will never forget 
 So as I walk through the street eyes and voices consume my mind, they stare ambiguously 
 Here I am with my insecurities, all my imperfections, crying out to a world that just wont listen 
 Lend me your ears, your hearts and your minds and discover what's missing 
 These words are the only thing keeping me from falling into the darkness 
 Where my thoughts are no longer my own 
 In the arms of my kin my family in the hearts of those sincere in the face of adversity here I am 
 Here I am ! 
 Free from hindrance from all doubt from all the voices calling me out 
 Free from hindrance from all doubt from all the voices calling me out 
 Here I am pouring my mind and heart into a world that doesn't listen, that doesn't listen 
 For those who remember, for those who care 
 Remember you are not alone 
 You are not alone 
 You are not alone 
 Here I am 
 Here I am stuck in a world that never listens 
 Here I am pouring my heart out I am not alone 
 I am not alone.
########### Solitude ###########
Leave me be, I grow tired of all your lies and false accusations 
 My only consolation... Painful, yet relishing a melody of relief, these voices wage wars in my mind 
 I retire from this world and embrace silence to rest my weary head and escape modern life 
 Oh the beauty of a realm with eternal peace 
 Leave me be, I grow tired of all your lies and false accusations 
 My only consolation... The beast that grows inside of me, the beast is solitude 
 Deep, dark, death-like solitude 
 The mist will settle on still water 
 GO! 
 I won't let this go! 
 I won't let this go! 
 Oh the beauty of a realm with eternal peace where the silence comforts his heart 
 In this life there are answers buried deep within yourself.
########### I Shook Hands With Death ###########
So stand the fuck up, show me that this life is worth living 
 Oh take this day and call it your own; this is your chance to redeem yourself 
 In a world where every single day counts, the cloke strickes twelve and I'm still in bed, staring at the ceiling 
 Will I ever amount to anything? 
 I will never know 
 I will never know 
 I will never know 
 Is there a purpose in this life to be fulfilled? 
 Is there a way to make sense of a life that will one day end? 
 Will anything I do be remembered? 
 Will these words live to be read by the eyes of a new generation? 
 I will be there for, for you I will be there 
 Pick your fucking self up and realise that one-day you will be a memory 
 Ashes to ashes and dust to dust 
 Stand the fuck up, show me that this life is worth living 
 Oh take this day and call it your own; this is your chance to redeem yourself 
 I will never know.
########### Genesis ###########
Every single moment time will melt away my life 
 What choices do I have? 
 How do I know is wrong or right? 
 How do I speak of what I see through my own eyes 
 Without telling you that the truth you’ve known is all a lie? 
 Stop living the lie, existing just because you can 
 I can be the dreamer 
 I can, I am
########### Scarab ###########
Crawling through the burning sand 
 Just a man who's lost in time (lost in time) 
 Distant memories of a life 
 That flow like waves within my mind 
 Look upon these calloused hands 
 As they move without a thought 
 Lucid wisdom in every atom 
 The golden mind of Thoth 
 We are the gods who have lost ourselves in forms 
 Like a scarab in the mind we fester in the soul 
 I have felt the burden of pain 
 For the last time 
 You want the fucking truth? 
 So you want the fucking truth? 
 The truth is we all suffer 
 The truth is we all suffer 
 We all suffer in life 
 We all suffer (suffer) in time 
 Beat me down, beat me down 
 Again and again, again and again 
 Beat me down, beat me down 
 Again and again, again and again 
 Beat me down, beat me down 
 Again and again, again and again 
 Beat me down, beat me down 
 Rain hell on me 
 In life we all suffer 
 But I will find my way 
 Through the darkness 
 This is the truth 
 In the back of my mind 
 It's been hiding away 
 For me to find 
 Dancing in the fire 
 We burn together 
 This pain will never end 
 Dancing in the fire 
 We burn together 
 This pain will never end
########### Windbreaker ###########
When the wind breaks before our very path 
 We are swept away (swept away) 
 I hear the wind howling my name 
 When the wind breaks before our very path 
 We are swept away (swept away) 
 I hear the wind howling my name 
 Leaving behind me everything I thought that i should be 
 Everything they told me was right 
 Leaving behind me everything I thought that I should be 
 Everything they said about life 
 We have made the sacrifices 
 We have been patient for long enough 
 It is our chance our time 
 Our time 
 Our time to rise the fuck up 
 I will break the wind 
 This road it leads so far away from home 
 I breathe in the air down a road to nowhere 
 Streams of oxygen soothe our forms 
 We long to breathe in the air around us 
 I feel the kiss of the breeze against my face 
 We long to feel the air around us 
 I'm packing up 
 I'm leaving here 
 Don't know when I'm coming back 
 Close your eyes and I disappear 
 I'm packing up 
 I'm leaving here 
 Don't know when I'm coming back 
 Close your eyes and I disappear 
 Floating free throughout this life 
 Reshaping my thoughts, time does wither the mind 
 And in due time 
 The life I thought I wanted I never seem to find 
 It might be dark, it might be cold 
 But if I ever feel like turning back 
 I just breathe and remember 
 Where I am (where I am) inside (inside) the dream 
 I will break the wind 
 When the wind breaks before our very path 
 We are swept away (swept away) 
 I hear the wind howling my name 
 When the wind breaks before our very path 
 We are swept away, swept away (swept away) 
 I hear the wind howling my name 
 Break! 
 I will break the wind

You think you see the world 
 I'll tell you nothing's how it seems 
 You think you see the world 
 I'll tell you nothing's how it seems 
 Organ of intuition, suppressed and maimed 
 Believed to be "Nothing but a Dream" 
 Dimethylated spirits on fire in me 
 Burning from the inside 
 Divorce from nature 
 Exile from Eden, confounding of tongues in a world full of lies 
 Why can't we open our eyes? 
 You think you see the world 
 I'll tell you nothing's how it seems 
 I've seen the world with the clearest of eyes 
 A world of fear, it's loud and clear and no surprise 
 They watch us from above 
 Can you feel the chaos overtaking us like a never ending plague 
 They watch us from above crying tears of blood 
 Crying tears of blood for the souls of the world (souls of the world) 
 They watch us from above 
 Now I hear the voices of an ancient race 
 Peering through the veil of time and space 
 Emerging from the void I am reborn 
 I see the world for what it really is 
 Distorted visions of heaven 
 I have discovered there's hope in my heart 
 For I am One 
 I am One 
 I am Love 
 I am Bliss, I am Everything 
 I am Everything you fear 
 Everything you've ever known 
 But don't be scared (but don't be scared), for I am here 
 You think you see the world 
 I'll tell you nothing's how it seems 
 All your dreams 
 Nothing's how, how it seems 
 All your dreams, all your dreams
########### Quantum Flux ###########
Set me free! 
 Feeling all the love, I swear that it's in the air 
 Leaving me floating forever, into infinity 
 I can see the colours dance when I close my eyes 
 Witnessing mysterious design 
 I can feel my body rush 
 From the love inside of me 
 Can't you see the joy of life is right before your eyes? 
 Infinite bliss, infinite love 
 Take a chance 
 Close your eyes 
 And just dream 
 It sets me free 
 Why can't you see the joy of life is right before your eyes? 
 Infinite bliss, infinite love 
 Take a chance 
 Close your eyes 
 And just dream 
 It sets me free 
 We walk around blinded, like children in the dark 
 So cold and so empty 
 How did this even start? 
 It's time to remember 
 What it's like to feel alive 
 Feel alive 
 Set me free 
 Set me free 
 Can't you see the joy of life is right before your eyes? 
 Infinite bliss, infinite love 
 Take a chance 
 Close your eyes 
 And just dream 
 It sets me free 
 Why can't you see the joy of life is right before your eyes? 
 Infinite bliss, infinite love 
 Take a chance 
 Close your eyes 
 And just dream 
 Feeling all the love I swear that it's in the air 
 Leaving me floating forever (forever), into infinity 
 Quantum fluctuations project into the air 
 Leaving me floating forever (forever), into infinity 
 Infinite potential 
 Infinite potential
########### Dream Awake ###########
Pay close attention 
 Or else you'll miss what's happening 
 Pay close attention 
 Or else you'll miss what's happening 
 We worship the sun 
 Yet we burn in its rays 
 So we seek out the dark 
 So we seek out the shade 
 It's such a mix of emotions 
 We call it regret 
 Chaotic patterns unfold 
 It's such an elegant mess 
 So I'll embrace all the pain 
 It's time to face all my fears 
 I've had enough of this game 
 Oh how it brings me to tears 
 And I can only be sure 
 One day I won't be alive 
 Stepping into the future 
 With the brightest of eyes 
 Let time stand still 
 For one second, please just stop 
 Oh my 
 It's frightening 
 It's right in front of my eyes 
 Oh my 
 It's right there 
 It's right in front of my eyes 
 Wake up from the nightmare 
 And become the dream 
 Wake up from the nightmare 
 And become the dream 
 That you've always been 
 That you've always seen 
 Wake up from the nightmare 
 Because you are the dream 
 I stand tall, grounded here on this earth 
 I'm looking up at the sky 
 With the stars in my eyes I'm alive 
 I'm looking up at the sky 
 I see life was my dream all along 
 I'm looking up at the sky 
 My self 
 My world 
 My people 
 My home, my everything 
 My self 
 My world 
 My people 
 My home, my everything

 And if you don't believe me you won't even see that what you're living in is hell 
 You're living in hell

The scent of lies is in the air tonight 
 The scent of lies is in the air tonight 
 The scent of lies is in the air tonight 
 We dance in a spell of lust 
 Those eyes of yours I cannot trust 
 The scent of lies (the scent of lies) is in the air tonight 
 We dance in a spell of lust 
 Those eyes of yours I cannot trust 
 You all act innocent but I have seen your true face 
 Stop lying to yourself 
 You're nothing but a fucking disgrace 
 You're a fucking disgrace 
 How can you trust anyone if you can't even trust your friends? 
 A masquerade of lies will kill us all in the end 
 The worst part of it all is I'm exactly the same 
 I'm looking around the room 
 I'll be the first one to blame 
 The scent of lies is in the air tonight 
 We dance in a spell of lust 
 Those eyes of yours I cannot trust 
 The scent of lies (the scent of lies) is in the air tonight 
 We dance in a spell of lust 
 Those eyes of yours I cannot trust 
 Take another look inside of yourself 
 Look at the mess you've made 
 Take another look inside of yourself 
 You're living in a masquerade 
 You're just a two-faced piece of shit 
 I'll make sure all you cowards quit 
 So hide yourself behind a mask 
 In a room of double faces 
 You can never hide what's in your past 
 Nothing changes at all, I'm still exactly the same 
 I'm looking around the room 
 I'll be the first to blame 
 The scent of lies is in the air tonight 
 We dance in a spell of lust 
 Those eyes of yours I cannot trust 
 The scent of lies (the scent of lies) is in the air tonight 
 Those eyes (those eyes), those eyes 
 To everyone who's held me up and everyone who's brought me down 
 I will never forget your faces, your voices 
 To everyone who's held me up and everyone who's brought me down 
 I will never forget your faces, your voices 
 Wink and smile for a while behind a mask 
 In a room of double faces 
 You can never hide what's in your past

[Instrumental] 
 [An excerpt of a Terrence Mckenna Speech:] 
 "We have to stop consuming our culture. We have to create culture. Don't watch TV, don't read magazines, don't even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow. The nexus of space and time, where you are now, is the most immediate sector of your universe. And if you're 
 worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody else, you are disempowered. You are giving it all away to icons. Icons which are maintained by an electronic media, so that you want to dress like X or have lips like Y. This is shit-brained, this kind of 
 thinking. That is all cultural diversion. And what is real is you and your friends, your associations, your highs, your orgasms, your hopes, your plans, and your fears. And we are told no. We're unimportant, we're peripheral, get a degree, get a job, get a this, get a 
 that, and then you're a player. You don't even want to play in that game. You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones 
 of a dying world. Where is that at?".

I'll carve my own name into the earth 
 I'll carve my own name into the earth 
 Don't tell me how to think 
 Don't tell me how to live my own life 
 I make my own decisions 
 And I'll pay the ultimate price 
 A collection of memories (memories) 
 How could I ever forget? (How could I ever forget?) 
 This is a journey of lessons (this is a journey of lessons) 
 From my birth to my death 
 A path of opposites 
 And all the choices in between 
 I'm running scared through this poetic tragic movie scene 
 The days turn into weeks 
 Months then turn into years 
 We'll stand the test of time 
 Our hope will persevere 
 I roam across the land 
 I wish to seek and understand 
 The truth about life and about who I really am 
 My blood is still young and karma's knocking at my door 
 It's time to stand up 
 This is my life I'm fighting for 
 It's time to set the record straight 
 No more excuses, no more complaints 
 Leave everything behind, get up and live your dream 
 Don't let it fade away 
 We are all born to be free 
 Fuck who you want me to be 
 Born to be free 
 A path of opposites 
 And all the choices in between 
 I'm running scared through this poetic tragic movie scene 
 The days turn into weeks 
 Months then turn into years 
 We'll stand the test of time 
 Our hope will persevere 
 I roam across the land 
 I wish to seek and understand 
 The truth about life and about who I really am 
 My blood is still young and karma's knocking at my door

 It's time to stand up 
 This is the life we're fighting for 
 This is the life we're fighting for 
 I'll carve my own name into the earth 
 I'll carve my own name into the earth 
 I'll carve my own name into the earth 
 I'll carve my own name into the earth
########### Soma ###########
Daydreamer, rise and shine 
 Daily déjà vu, yet still surprised 
 Watch the weary world with gray scale eyes 
 A millionaire in my mind with a pocket full of lint 
 Confined to a puzzle where the pieces don't fit 
 Stare into a broken mirror, reflecting shards of fear 
 Daydreamer now's your time, I refuse to die here 
 I refuse to die here 
 I see a prison of a city, destined for collapse 
 I see the worker bees buzzing in circles, fighting over scraps 
 I see a concrete garden of lead and steel trees 
 I see the clouds swell with synthetic disease 
 A visionless man can't balance the scale 
 The court of conscience slips secrets on the gavel 
 Written in Braille, lie just beyond my fingertips 
 Daydreamer, rise and shine 
 Daily déjà vu, yet still surprised 
 Watch the weary world with gray scale eyes 
 A millionaire in my mind with a pocket full of lint 
 Confined to a puzzle where the pieces don't fit 
 Stare into a broken mirror reflecting shards of fear 
 Daydreamer, now's your time, I refuse to die here 
 I refuse to die here

Time in constant motion 
 Like the shifting desert sands 
 Slipping through my hands 
 Chasing down the minutes that turn into days 
 Seconds get shorter as years fall away 
 Chasing down my dreams under borrowed light 
 A mirage in the distance escaping my sight 
 Driven to live or driven apart 
 What's inside us when we depart 
 Driven to live outside of regret 
 Time is finite, the clocks are set 
 Driven to live or driven apart 
 I realize my flame is burning away 
 Starward searching I will find my way 
 The power of the mind ready to combust 
 I will show you fear in a handful of dust 
 Combust 
 My flame is fleeting but I will live and learn 
 Rise and burn, tick and turn, rise and burn 
 Time in constant motion, 
 Like the shifting desert sands 
 Slipping through my hands 
 Driven to live or driven apart 
 What's inside us when we depart 
 Driven to live outside of regret 
 Time is finite, the clocks are set 
 Driven to live or driven apart 
 Combust

You can be the change 
 Pain is the elixir that keeps us entertained 
 Flowing through a looking glass 
 Numbing stinging eyes of shame 
 Absence rinses guilt away 
 But our conscience is still stained 
 You can be the catalyst 
 The ripple to the wave 
 You can be the change 
 One small step will shake the earth 
 We're sedated into submission 
 Apathetic addicts 
 Hooked on tunnel vision 
 Mindless progress is a dire setback 
 Humanity is slipping through the cracks 
 Let the pathways through our hearts guide us 
 To a universe where love survives us 
 You can be the change 
 One small step will shake the earth 
 Let the pathways through our hearts guide us 
 To a universe where love survives us

The earth gets smaller with everything i see 
 A technicolor picture on a black and white screen 
 There's a blackout on the ground 
 But an energy above the trees 
 Just past the edge of sound 
 So climb the ladder with me 
 Wanderer, survey the shrinking globe 
 All your troubles seem smaller 
 The farther you go 
 Wanderer, never coming home 
 All your troubles seem smaller 
 The farther you go 
 Shed the dead weight 
 Flight will follow 
 From the island that world will surely swallow 
 Falling our of orbit 
 My thoughts scrambled and distorted 
 Sailing through space in a panic 
 To escape the static 
 Escape the static 
 Wanderer, survey the shrinking globe 
 All your troubles seem smaller 
 The farther you go 
 Wanderer, never coming home 
 All your troubles seem smaller 
 The farther you go 
 How clear is the air up there 
 Breathe easy 
 Breathe easy as you leave the atmosphere 
 Breathe easy

So cold, my soul's numb 
 Like an icy breeze on solstice morning 
 The worst enemy's one that's homegrown 
 This is more than just a faceless warning 
 Don't let the world rot 
 Don't let the world rot 
 Hanging by a thread they just putrefy 
 Our blood, our birth, our sky 
 And we will not stand by 
 Don't let the world rot 
 So warm the sun burns my soul 
 Like the fossils in the earth they take my breath 
 Black blood bleeding heart filled stone 
 Take the power away from the hands of death 
 A web of minds connected 
 Take purpose, take action, cause a reaction 
 Entangle the spiders, make sense of this mess 
 A mind at large is a power they can't repress 
 We are all connected 
 We are one you and I 
 Yeah, we will not stand by 
 Don't let the world rot 
 Omnipotent mind at large 
 Sick of living underhanded 
 This is our life we command it 
 Go 
 We can't all hide in fear 
 A time of reckoning is near 
 We are all connected 
 Don't let the world rot 
 We can't all hide in fear 
 A time of reckoning is near 
 We are all connected

 Entangle the spiders, make sense of this mess

 Sick of living underhanded 
 This is our life we command it

Follow me underwater 
 Until the searchlights leave the shore 
 Follow me underwater 
 Until we find what we're looking for 
 Plastic oceans, plastic farms 
 Cover your footprints like a band-aid on a broken arm 
 They found the pipeline through the soul in the soil 
 I thought this place never changed 
 But now the reefs are bleeding smells of oil 
 And the forests are up in flames 
 You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep 
 While your bed burned 
 You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep 
 While your bed burned 
 Give me a reason, tell me why we lost our reason 
 Tell me the truth, not an excuse 
 Cause we have everything to lose 
 Plastic oceans, plastic farms 
 Cover your footprints like a band-aid on a broken arm 
 There's a cancer in our lifeblood, so silently it grew 
 The streams of least resistance poison me and poison you 
 There's a virus in the air, that drags the wind out from my chest 
 I don't see a way out 
 All I see is a sphere of unrest 
 Show me a way out 
 Show me a way out 
 Show me a way out 
 Follow me underwater 
 Until the searchlights leave the shore 
 Follow me underwater 
 Until we find what we're looking for 
 Plastic oceans, plastic farms 
 Cover your footprints like a band-aid on a broken arm 
 You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep 
 While your bed burned 
 You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep

So alone in our digital world 
 The walls are closing in 
 Shrinking down to the box in the palm of my hand 
 The shock has settled in 
 Fibers and wires 
 Feed me the link that we desire 
 Every circuit getting smarter 
 Every signal getting stronger 
 But our ties are getting weaker 
 And I see us sinking deeper 
 I see it sinking deeper 
 Flawed relations of ones and zeroes connecting us to our digital heroes 
 An anti-social network where everyone's a fucking expert 
 I see it sinking deeper 
 Hollow as a hologram 
 Electricity without the spar 
 Hearts left to flicker and fade 
 Out in the dark 
 So alone in our digital world 
 Impulses flowing through my veins 
 Impulses flowing through copper 
 Flowing in waves 
 It feels so close 
 Yet so far away 
 Every circuit getting smarter 
 Every signal getting stronger 
 But our ties are getting weaker 
 And I see us sinking deeper 
 I see it sinking deeper 
 The walls are closing in

Weightless my body 
 Floats in eternity 
 Weightless beyond the earth's gravity 
 A euphoric perpetual gaze

 Beneath a luminescent haze

 Guided by familiar sight and sound 
 I let go of what weighs me to the ground 
 Weightless my body 
 Floats in eternity 
 Weightless beyond the earth's gravity

The narrow road is all I know 
 No map to guide us 
 No compass beside us 
 The narrow road 
 The great unknown 
 The grater sacrifice grants the greatest gift in life 
 No more assembly lines of aspirations connecting carbon copy clones 
 Every artifact is marching like commodities of flesh and bone 
 The consistency of our censored thoughts 
 Tread a static course 
 Ordinary people: your outlook is lethal 
 Chiseling away imperfections 
 Until rough edges are same and smooth 
 The tools have now become too blunt 
 To break any of the rules 
 Post-modern minds bleached blank and clean 
 Drawing pixelated lines 
 In duller shades that my eyes have ever seen

Save us 
 If you thought you knew it all 
 Don't shift your view, you might slip and fall 
 A long way down and down this rabbit hole 
 If the tunnel runs any deeper 
 You might come out the other side of the world 
 Maybe upside down you'll be able to see 
 This isn't what it seems, we are far from free 
 We're caught in the undertow 
 Deeper and deeper into the unknown 
 We're caught in the undertow 
 Follow the leader down with the undertow 
 Action floats in limbo 
 Like driftwood in the sea under CCTV, so dig down deep 
 The more you uncover, the more you disbelieve 
 The more you will discover we are far from free 
 Heroes exposing corruption in who we obey 
 Blow the whistle from a burning stake 
 The whistle blows from the burning stake 
 Corruption won't keep revolution at bay 
 We're caught in the undertow 
 Deeper and deeper into the unknown 
 We're caught in the undertow 
 Follow the leader down with the undertow 
 Spied on, lifelong, collection 24/7

 Satellites track our lives beyond the sky, not even your mind 
 Can hide from big brother's eyes 
 It's time to take back our home

I am what I create 
 Lashed by tongues of electric fire 
 Shimmering rivers of crystalline 
 Run through frozen glimpses in time 
 And I just can't ignore this sight 
 Pouring down on me relentlessly 
 I just can't ignore this feeling 
 Deafened by rolling waves of realization 
 Frozen, mesmerized in the rain 
 In my darkest days 
 I only saw the shades of gray 
 In a world that drips in color 
 Droplets of life form in free fall 
 In convalescence, they hammer into the soil 
 Carving new streams of essence through turmoil 
 I am just as fluid, as immortal and lucid 
 As the earth that morphs in the violence of a thunderstorm 
 My life is what I make of my trials and my mistakes 
 My life is what I make, I am what I create 
 I am what I create 
 I am what I create 
 I am what I create 
 In my darkest days 
 I only saw the shades of gray 
 In a world that drips in color

Rise up 
 Rise up 
 Break free as one 
 See through the eyes of the sun 
 Witness the bitter end of all 
 We peeled our stares from the mysteries of the universe 
 And drew them down onto each other 
 A waterfall of knowledge cascaded into bullets for our brothers 
 Led to our deaths by providence 
 When we were born to discover 
 We were born to discover 
 Humankind, seek the sky 
 That we were born to discover 
 Wash away utopia with the tears of the undead 
 Slipping, sliding, fighting our way down the steepest descent 
 We'll meet our fate, spellbound primates 
 Bathed in red, witness the bitter end 
 Told to be a delusion 
 We cast and sealed our seeds of evolution 
 Wisdom age old, dormant inside all 
 Until it's time to break the mold 
 Break free as one 
 See through the eyes of the sun 
 Break free as one 
 See through the eyes of the sun 
 Look down at our earth 
 Through the eyes of the sun 
 Humankind's lines don't divide 
 Through the eyes of the sun 
 Rise up 
 Break free as one

In an age where stars only draw us in 
 Gaze is swept from our mother who birthed us here 
 She's stormy, doubted and over-relied on 
 Take a good long look at that horizon 
 We bleed it dry, we multiply 
 And soon we'll say it's time to fly 
 So scorch the host 
 Silenced by the solar wind, forests evergreen 
 Wither to sand, there's still shade in this wasteland 
 Shadows of towering glass span as far as you can set your sights on 
 Take a good long look at that horizon 
 We bleed it dry, we multiply 
 And soon we'll say it's time to fly 
 So scorch the host 
 She's stormy, doubted and over-relied on 
 She's stormy, doubted and over-relied on 
 She's stormy, doubted and over-relied on 
 Take a good long look at that horizon 
 Open your eyes 
 Two worlds collide 
 Open your eyes 
 We bleed it dry, we multiply 
 And soon we'll say it's time to fly 
 So scorch the host and watch it die 
 Watch it die

I'm breathing just to pass the time 
 I forgot to eat tonight 
 Just running down the clock today 
 With hope the ache will go away 
 Body starts to shake, head begins to spin 
 Leaves me in its wake, I'm paralyzed with pain 
 We suffer in a heartmachine 
 Unstable, feeling everything 
 Pins and needles stitching up my skin 
 We suffer 
 Hope is strange; sometimes it leads you on 
 There's no exception when you're halfway gone 
 A second chance, flash of light that brought me to my knees 
 A burning vision etched in memories 
 Body starts to shake, head begins to spin 
 Leaves me in its wake, I'm paralyzed with pain 
 We suffer in a heartmachine 
 Unstable, feeling everything 
 Pins and needles stitching up my skin 
 We suffer, trapped in a heartmachine 
 Time heals the wounds, it builds up strength inside 
 Facing the truth, there's nothing left to hide 
 We suffer 
 Unstable 
 Pins and needles 
 We suffer, trapped in a heartmachine
########### Intuition ###########
Why do we subscribe 
 To a universal thread that weaves the fabric of our lives? 
 Ask why without batting an eye 
 We're so accepting, question everything 
 Question everything you know 
 Fracture of doubt 
 Crack to a chasm in an instant 
 Swallowing whole, the broken bones of our broken home 
 Into an ocean of disorder 
 But my view through the water's crystal clear 
 And I've got something that you need to hear 
 We don't know who we are 
 We wander never knowing 
 Feudal stone walls 
 Stop these oceans overflowing 
 Virtuosos wrote your thoughts in a symphony 
 Paradigms, transcribed under the supervision 
 Of conductors to our dissonant chorus 
 We orchestrate their composition; they call it order 
 We don't know who we are 
 We reap what we are sowing 
 Fabric of our lives catches our eyes 
 We abide unknowing 
 Wander, question, find your obsession 
 Knowledge beckons, find your obsession 
 We don't know who we are 
 We wander never knowing 
 We don't know who we are 
 Or why we are following 
 This script of reality 
 Where we become the casualty 
 Conditioned in an intellectual prison 
 Fuck this system 
 Follow your intuition 
 Wander, question, find your obsession 
 Knowledge beckons, find your obsession 
 Wander, question, find your obsession 
 Knowledge beckons, find your obsession 
 Question everything you know

Comatose 
 In the arms of Morpheus 
 Drifting away to a place 
 Where there's more than this 
 Blindfolded visionary, eyes lost in the black and bleak 
 Chasing footsteps in the dark, lost for where they'll lead 
 Idols and stars shower light on the sublime 
 Blinding your mind's eye, bright as your dreams shine 
 Blinding your mind's eye 
 Reclaim your life 
 Reclaim your life 
 From the iron grip of social design 
 Reclaim your life 
 Your cycle around the sun is eclipsing 
 Like most of us I was misled 
 Into a swarm of noise and distortion 
 Eroding my deepest thoughts 
 Before my inner voice had spoken 
 To remind me I'm gifted with the power to dream 
 To see what has never been seen 
 But I handed it over, consumed by culture 
 Cloaking the eyes of the visionary 
 Comatose 
 In the arms of Morpheus 
 Drifting away to a place 
 Where there's more than this

########### Fade ###########
When nothing could be done to salvage what was lost 
 The chosen one, a victim of passion 
 He feels the hate rise up, a war that can't be won 
 The mourning son survives through disaster 
 The soul that suffered 
 All that's left behind is a memory that fades 
 Like a rope around your neck binds you to a resting place 
 And the price that I have paid when I watched you pass away 
 Is the everlasting pain and a memory that fades away 
 When all he had was gone, a place we once belonged 
 The chosen one finds an existence 
 Second coming life, daylight pushes on 
 The mourning son, no longer a victim 
 All that's left behind is a memory that fades 
 Like a rope around your neck binds you to a resting place 
 And the price that I have paid when I watched you pass away 
 Is the everlasting pain and a memory that fades away 
 The soul that suffered sleeps tonight 
 In the ashes of his demons 
 Demons 
 Daylight holds no salvation 
 From this labyrinth of desolation 
 The fiery hells in his mind 
 Will burn to the ground in time 
 All that's left behind is a memory that fades 
 Like a rope around your neck binds you to a resting place 
 And the price that I have paid when I watched you pass away 
 Is the everlasting pain and a memory that fades away 
 The chosen one 
 The mourning son

Pilot of the biomachine 
 Manning the controls of a babbling monkey 
 The circuits behind the interface can't be seen 
 So the truth is up to me, is this life but a dream? 
 Is reality 
 All my senses perceive? 
 All my senses perceive? 
 It tears me apart from the inside 
 The story we've accepted with malleable minds 
 Dogmatic perceptions designed 
 In egotistical pride have led us blind 
 Short of sight, wondering why 
 Our lives feel like they're lacking meaning 
 We have stopped believing this is just a ride 
 This is just a ride 
 Is reality 
 All my senses perceive? 
 Is what I touch and I see 
 All that lies in front of me? 
 We wonder why our lives feel like 
 They're lacking meaning, we've stopped believing 
 This is just a ride 
 It's just a ride 
 This is just a ride

He saw the life slip from her emerald eyes 
 Confusion, illusion, had soaked up her mind 
 She clutched his hand, whispered her soul 
 "I never wanted to grow so old 
 Life's agony, turn off the machine 
 Let me leave this world with dignity" 
 Just let me leave this world 
 Bed of nails under the guillotine 
 Wake me up when my heart stops beating 
 When my heart stops beating 
 Wipe those tears of grief away, young man 
 Let me leave this world 
 Let me leave this world in peace 
 Turn off the machine, turn off the machine 
 Let me leave this world in peace 
 Raise me from this bed of nails 
 And let the angels carry me away 
 Carry me, carry me away 
 Bed of nails under the guillotine 
 Wake me up when my heart stops beating 
 When my heart stops beating 
 Let me leave this world

The last of our martyrs seeks no adoration 
 From his castle in the air of eternal vibration 
 We won't lose sight of the lasting words he wrote 
 We won't lose sight of what matters most 
 A shining beacon of wisdom 
 Armed to the teeth, fearless conviction 
 Now that he's gone we're going to miss him 
 Immortalised between the lines 
 Conceived by a human heart inside 
 He once said to us 
 "My friend, hope is a prison" 
 But the hope his chords sung 
 Only spread love in a hollow crowned kingdom 
 There are no fighters left here anymore 
 There are no fighters left here anymore 
 There are no fighters left here anymore 
 See you on the other side of that open door 
 We won't lose sight 
 We won't lose sight of the lasting words he wrote 
 We won't lose sight 
 We won't lose sight of what matters most

 And emerge from the desert of reality 
 Rotating gears to dominate, ressurected now for judgement day, to purge your sin 
 Burn! Innocence is lost, all faith is gone 
 And now you deserve to extinct 
 Nailed to the cross, you're punished for your lies

Walking among idiot people, I can feel their inanity like a spasm 
 Running into my head 
 I'm on my way, opposed to your common sense 
 I don't give a fuck about your hollow words 
 I turn my back, to all your lies, to the fuckin' strain 
 Breakin'this shape of scorn 
 So get away stupid asshole, I won't follow you in cold static currents 
 In reverse of usual trend, I kick your ass and standing proud 
 Hey man, I don't care about what I'm supposed to be 
 I'm on my way, opposed to your common sense 
 I don't give a fuck about your hollow words 
 I turn my back, to all your lies, to the fuckin' strain 
 Breakin'the shape of scorn 
 So get away stupid asshole, I won't follow you in cold static currents 
 Don't hesitate to ignore me, I don't need your fuckin'lie 
 Don't need control, I just need to find my path, to stay awake 
 So I'll never go back, I will keep straight on track 
 I'm tired of your vanity, tired of waiting for a sign 
 So you can stay rotting here 
 I don't give shit of your rules 
 Prepare yourself, I'm coming now
########### Critical Mass ###########
Circumstances seem so fool: it's what I think about 
 As the morning come on a new fuckin' day 
 Exactly the same as the day before 
 The day before you leave the place 
 To go thousand miles away from me 
 I fall so down, in a pool of memories 
 Drowned deep into my regrets and suffering 
 Tell me why I have to stay alone to face this fuckin' pain 
 I guess you've tried, but nothing replace the emptiness 
 Now you're gone, there's only tears that now remain into my heart 
 I will exchange my soul just to see you one more time 
 And I can see the gun, shinning so bright 
 I can feel the hole 
 The shadows covering your eyes as your body die 
 The blood sheded on the floor, and this vision makes me sick 
 I couldn't excepted this will end in tears 
 I fall so down, in a pool of memories 
 Drowned deep into my regrets and suffering 
 Tell me why I have to stay alone to face this fuckin' pain 
 I guess you've tried, but nothing replace the emptiness 
 Now you're gone, there's only tears that now remain into my heart 
 I will exchange my soul just to see you one more time 
 I am to condamned to realize, to stand alone with my weakness and fears 
 Reality fall to pieces, my mind is bleeding, I've lost the will to live now 
 Why?... god... destruction... salvation... destruction 
 I am to condamned to realize, to stand alone with my weakness and fears 
 Reality fall to pieces, my mind is bleeding, I've lost the will to live 
 Tell me why I have to stay alone to face this fuckin' pain 
 I guess you've tried, but nothing replace the emptiness 
 Now you're gone, there's only tears that now remain into my heart 
 I will exchange my soul just to see you one more time
########### ReEvolution (Syntax Airplay Edit) ###########
The machine has failed to victimized, to broke us on our knees 
 And no longer we hear their poisoned words of fear 
 Corporate rape is ending now, we leave our chains and rise 
 We fuck the system 
 Liberation revive our freedom 
 Re-evolution is near, the time has come for us 
 Masses on march, we want to retake our destiny 
 To break the government lies 
 We stand the fire of oppression and move unchained 
 The system collapse below the pressure of insurgence 
 Anger solidified by the years will lead our steps 
 No more submission for our mind 
 No more constrain and rights denied 
 We clear our future now 
 Liberation revive our freedom 
 Re-evolution is near, the time has come for us
########### Decoy (Radio Slave Edit) ###########
A mass of emptied minds, docil imitators, we never try to see the truth 
 Corrupted to the core, we are breeding in the vaccum, our words are useless noise 
 Automaton chained to common patterns, so inane 
 Fuck now! adaptable, manipulated, you consume and then, you're erased 
 Shit! submit to system pressure, programmed to never deviate 
 We 've learned to hide, to blame, to follow, to never askin'why 
 We only want to be quiet, to be safe... we're blind 
 Could we choose to live, could we choose to exist? 
 Trapped into descent, just waiting to revive 
 We've locked our soul, so close to the other, but so far 
 We remain so cold inside, running in reverse, in destruction we smile 
 Could we choose to live, could we choose to exist? 
 Trapped into descent, just waiting to revive 
 Plunged in delusion, as a puppet marching to the sound of lies 
 In cruelty we collide, slave to delusion, we define this perfect lake of courage 
 Reflecting in our eyes, all things now retaken, all things we've forgotten 
 (All things we've forgotten) 
 We 've learned to hide, to blame, to follow, to never askin'why 
 We only want to be quiet, to be safe... we're blind 
 Control, it's what it's all about: trust the pigs and eat their shit 
 We don't give about truth, we're just leaving into dream of perfect norm 
 Without recognition for misery 
 Could we choose to live, could we choose to exist? 
 Trapped into descent, so down, just waiting to revive again 
 Could we choose to live, could we choose to exist? 
 Trapped into descent, so down, just waiting to revive again
########### Emma-0 ###########
Mutilate me, hurt me now 
 You've cut your wings to justify my guiltiness 
 We're all slave of some sadistic obsession 
 You put this needle in my head, a needle called "pain" 
 Let me hate you, I'll never save you from yourself 
 Hold me, destroy me, tomorrow will never be the same 
 You reveal the worst 
 My inclination to forgive every sin 
 I'm enabled to avoiding stare at your halo of desperation 
 Malevolent love, it's all you are 
 There's no redemption in your humiliating smile 
 You drain the life outside, your grace is a lie 
 You put your seal in my flesh, so deep within 
 Let me hate you, I'll never save you from yourself 
 Hold me, destroy me, tomorrow will never be the same 
 Let me hate you, I'll never save you from yourself 
 Break me, constrain me, like an angel falling on burning grounds 
 There's no rest in your lethal embrace 
 Surrounded by your disdain 
 There's nothing more I can hope from you 
 In this hell on earth, I've already sold my soul 
 Let me end this dead-end game 
 You've corrupted me step by step 
 Like a worm, you're devouring me to the core 
 I wish to die in your deadly arms 
 Exquisite devil in disguise
########### Ego Bypass Generator ###########
You delight yourself in a paranoid state of mind 
 A bunch of mischief talking shit, it's what you're all about 
 You celebrate yourself in filth and self-indulgence 
 As you believe you own the world 
 Fuck you! 
 You blame us all to never trust your lies (trust your lies) 
 Your lame words won't ever justify wasting our precious time 
 You want it all, could kill for five seconds of fame 
 No matter who you suck: you're just a hopeless case 
 You rate yourself as fucking number one 
 A poisoned ego oversized but undefined 
 No hope you'll improve yourself 
 No reason to try to understand 
 You blame us all to never trust your lies (trust your lies) 
 Your lame words won't ever justify wasting our precious time 
 A worthless, miserable one, absurd and non-relevant 
 You'll burn yourself with all your hate 
 You're tainted, devoid of soul 
 A vain being to nullify with no remorse 
 No hope you'll improve yourself 
 No reason to try to understand 
 You blame us all to never trust your lies (trust your lies) 
 Your lame words won't ever justify wasting our precious time 
 You blame us all to never trust your lies (trust your lies) 
 Your lame words won't ever justify wasting our precious time
########### Revive My Wounds ###########
I don't need your scornful reply, I'm sick of your constant denial 
 Don't want to face your immorality 
 Irritated by your selfish smile, I cannot stand your bitter hate 
 Your presence is a pain 
 Hurt 
 My soul with all your fucking lies 
 I'm searching for redemption 
 I wish I could find an answer 
 Words are perfect deceivers 
 They revive my wounds forever 
 A black star moving around a pole of raw negativity 
 Like void never fulfilled 
 The wage of sins is to fall 
 In self-destructive schemes 
 I feel so numb, I feel so cold, your vain, delusive heresy 
 Makes me nonexistent and dead inside 
 I would rather disappear, or shed my blood onto the ground 
 Than having to face your sheer vanity 
 Hurt 
 My soul with all your fucking lies 
 I'm searching for redemption 
 I wish I could find an answer 
 Words are perfect deceivers 
 They revive my wounds forever 
 I taste my anger, reacting to preserve my mind 
 I left your twisted, pervert world behind 
 Control is over, no more tainted promises 
 My eyes are open wide 
 I'm searching for redemption 
 I wish I could find an answer 
 Words are perfect deceivers 
 They revive my wounds forever
########### Isolate ###########
So many wrong ways, so many scars 
 So many empty days into this world of grey 
 I clench my hands, standing on edge, now isolated 
 With no redemption to be found 
 I've wasted so many words 
 I've grown into the realm of lies 
 I have no purpose or glorious goals 
 To lead my soul 
 God, tell me why I have to face 
 This state of slow disintegration 
 So many gestures, so many nights 
 Trying to fight my fears, to delay misery 
 A very last time before I die 
 I let it go away and I just give up once again 
 All my expectations, all the lives I could have dreamt of 
 All of this will turn to dust, scattered in a wind of pestilence 
 A random shift in suffering scales, a vanishing grain of sand 
 Into the sea of nothingness, I've lost all hope or faith 
 I fall deep into oblivion, a wish to not share the pain 
 I'm far beyond all denial and vain negation 
 I desecrate the foundations of my own fragile existence 
 I'm lost into the purest darkness 
 I suffocate under the weight of grief and deception 
 I've wasted so many words 
 I've grown into the realm of lies 
 I have no purpose or glorious goals 
 To lead my soul 
 God, tell me why I have to face 
 This state of slow disintegration 
 Tell me why we all remain 
 Engulfed into sheer emptiness 
 I cannot see the light beyond
########### Dynamic ###########
Everyday, cold suffering 
 But everyday I resurrect 
 I expect nothing from this world of shit 
 Disappointed I'm standing away 
 Confused and lost, I plunge in suffering 
 Am I just idiot or vain? 
 And every time I have to breathe 
 In every way I can feel the pain 
 A liquid fire burning my lungs 
 An acid nail into my brain 
 Confused and lost, I plunge in suffering 
 Am I just idiot or vain? 
 Why should I agree with common apathy 
 Self-destruction seems so sweet 
 Denial is what I choose to preserve sanity 
 I'm caught into a dynamic of hate 
 Like a relentless movement leading to our damnation 
 Existence is a bitch, happiness is a word 
 Love is such an empty lie 
 Confused and lost, I plunge in suffering 
 Am I just idiot or vain? 
 What is given today can be retaken fast 
 In constant wait we dwell, vanity is all we share 
 Whatever we do we stay blind, rewarded with fast demise 
 Massively divided we've lost all faith 
 How to size how much we've failed? 
 I vanish, purified, and escape through decay 
 All I could do will never clear the veil before your eyes 
 Wrapping the constrained minds into a shape of fear 
 There's no more way to reverse destiny or destroy reality
########### Neurodrive ###########
Shall I remain blind and divided? 
 I've tried so hard to find a way to disable this constant plague 
 My death is a rebirth, a resurrection to cure the soul and touch perfection again 
 I define the schemes for a new design of self-perception in my mind 
 Recreating my flesh now purified, an endeavour to clear the pain 
 I disconnect all patterns, disintegrate my blood and bones, then analyze consequences 
 My body is weak, in narcosis now refine, clarity and suffering thus collide 
 Deconstruction of reality should help me to 
 Understand this violent decay 
 Electric neurodrive to induce self-demise 
 Could I become God if I bled enough? 
 Synthetic pulse eradicates the structure of my thought 
 I recompose my nerves and re-arrange cells inside 
 A rough, carnal unit to rise 
 I am falling on my knees, my soul is burning 
 Dysfunctions of DNA creating components for an emerging spark of creation 
 I crush the border of my ego and I descend into a void 
 I'm floating through the perfect view 
 Of hidden truth behind this divine veil of light 
 And purge the poison of delusion from my veins 
 I modify levels of existence 
 The sequence is accomplished, my mind is now rewired
########### Permafrost ###########
I've buried my joy and faith, 
 those deceitful delusions 
 And thus I've found a way 
 to purify my mind from desolation 
 What could I gain but suffering and deception, 
 if innocence is lost? 
 There is no cure for this tainted desire, 
 when everything was done 
 I am nothing but frustration, 
 I end my life with no regrets 
 And, falling on my knees, 
 I'm still waiting to find redemption 
 There is no cure for this tainted desire 
 to expurgate the pain out of my head 
 My flesh is cold, I feel no pain - 
 the bitter art of dying fast 
 A shroud of frost cover my skin - 
 my bleeding soul is lifeless 
 The barrel of gun against my head 
 is like a promise to 
 Release my fears on a wall of concrete: 
 what a fine day to extinct 
 What could I gain but suffering and deception, 
 if innocence is lost? 
 There is no cure for this tainted desire 
 to expurgate the pain out of my head 
 My flesh is cold, I feel no pain - 
 the bitter art of dying fast 
 A shroud of frost cover my skin - 
 my bleeding soul is lifeless 
 What is existence but a relentless demise? 
 To live is to die, with no absolution 
 Nothing could be saved, my heart is dry 
 I bury my ego and choke my hopes 
 I've cursed myself 
 for this foretaste of ruins or just a glimpse of light 
 Ascending like a star I've discovered my own mortality 
 My flesh is cold, I feel no pain - 
 the bitter art of dying fast 
 A shroud of frost cover my skin - 
 my bleeding soul is lifeless 
 Am I the one to blame If I've failed to live?
########### Orbital ###########
I separate darkness and light, reorganise primordial chaos at will 
 Reconstructing galaxies pulsing to the rhythm of my thought 
 I gather the collision course of thousand exploding stars 
 Those soon collapse on themselves into a massive discharge of cosmic pulse 
 I'm gazing trough the universe 
 Constraining waves of light 
 I touch the core of stellar mass 
 And I am now reborn 
 I contemplate the face of god 
 Reflecting my own soul 
 I'm standing in orbital phase and become eternal 
 Inertial I'm floating now, compressing gravity 
 I'm moving in the perfect sphere of the creation divine 
 Like a supernova waiting for the final implosion 
 Coalescent and irradiate, I can see the spectrum of reality 
 I reactivate atomic movement and collect photons into my hands 
 Bursting like millions of suns to illuminate my path for centuries 
 I melt my flesh with all matter 
 I melt my mind with all mankind 
 I'm gazing trough the universe 
 Constraining waves of light 
 I touch the core of stellar mass 
 And I am now reborn 
 I contemplate the face of god 
 Reflecting my own soul 
 I'm standing in orbital phase and become eternal 
 Inertial I'm floating now, compressing gravity 
 I'm moving in the perfect sphere of the creation divine 
 ...eternal!
########### Twelve Megatons Gravity ###########
I'm not a redeemer, I'm not another saviour 
 Don't want to save your world, I would rather make it burn in flames 
 I spit on all the doves, your good intentions are masturbation 
 To hide a simple fact: you're scarred of your needs of violence 
 I am the new salvation 
 I am the voice screaming in your head 
 I have no compassion 
 I annihilate the smile on your face 
 Death is all around me 
 Blood is why we lick their feet 
 All celebrate the reign of pigs 
 Leisure and atrocity 
 Flesh is melted again 
 Bind in orgies of carnal guilt 
 I want to smash them all 
 For drowning themselves in their semen and lust 
 I don't agree with happiness, don't want to be a brainwashed slave 
 I bit the hand and cut the leash, the rope of comfort around my neck 
 And enjoy the bitter taste of watching all delusions fade away 
 Your iron dream is wrapped into a velvet shape of ignorance 
 And still you keep on deny the pain 
 The itch running onto your skin 
 The burnt of profound misery 
 Do you enjoy the taste of shame, the blade of vanity? 
 A slaughtered heaven, a place of fool's sanity [?], 
 A mouthful of injuries, it's all what you deserved 
 I am the bullet on the run, I force my way into your brain 
 Extracting all corrupted words with the massive strain of a gun 
 I'm not a redeemer, I'm not another saviour 
 Don't want to save your world, I would rather make it burn in flames 
 I spit on all the doves, your good intentions are masturbation 
 To hide a simple fact: you're scarred of your needs of violence 
 I am the new salvation 
 I am the voice screaming in your head 
 I have no compassion 
 I annihilate the smile on your face 
 A slaughtered heaven, a place of fool's sanity [?], 
 A mouthful of injuries, it's all what you deserved 
 I am the bullet on the run, I force my way into your brain 
 Extracting all corrupted words with the massive strain of a gun 
 You suck!
########### Ethernity ###########
This cold morning is like a consecration 
 A procession of souls that will never end 
 The time of remembrance and disillusions 
 Shall dry the liquid pain running in my veins 
 Drain my blood and drown me in the sun, 
 forever cured and sanctified 
 Now reborn, we cross the Rubicon, 
 Eternity will blend our minds in one 
 I close my eyes and shiver in resurrection 
 Standing on this ground of awakening 
 I float into the light of revelation 
 "Expire, and thus revive in the purest form" 
 Drain my blood and drown me in the sun, 
 forever cured and sanctified 
 Now reborn, we cross the Rubicon, 
 Eternity will blend our minds in one 
 I watch the sky and prey for my deliverance 
 An endless whisper to find redemption 
 To breath the fire of all creation, divine, purified 
 "Ad Aeternam... Gloria"
########### Technocracy ###########
How can we live this slow demise? 
 How can we live and deny it? 
 Ecstatic lies explode our minds 
 The age of technocracy 
 Relentless rules improved to increased control 
 Brutal enforcement to break disorder 
 They bring the string of full security 
 A world of disabused norms 
 How can we live this slow demise? 
 How can we live and deny it? 
 Ecstatic lies explode our minds 
 The age of technocracy 
 Were docile dogs, obedient 
 Apathy growing, serialized 
 A concrete tool for slavery 
 Collapsing in psychosis, they're spreading genocide 
 Perfect unit of mass-corruption 
 There's no way to protest, there's no way to escape 
 Regulated delusion as logical solution 
 How can we live this slow demise? 
 How can we live and deny it? 
 Ecstatic lies explode our minds 
 The age of technocracy 
 We are standing so blind, just watching the ground so afraid 
 Disconnected inside we're bleeding the poison of distress 
 Love is lost forever, could we shine again? 
 Pain is breeding together, together we remain defenseless 
 Fears keep us so hollow, could we find a way? 
 We wish to break the walls we built around ourselves 
 We're falling down 
 We're falling down 
 We're falling down again 
 We're falling down 
 We're falling down 
 We're falling far from grace again 
 again
########### Plasmaterial ###########
And once again 
 We feel the silence 
 So far away 
 From being able 
 To wait for deliverance 
 We consume ourselves 
 Into the flames 
 Of a perfect pain 
 As we stand alone 
 Separated 
 We're floating down 
 The complex stream of existence 
 Grey shadow plays reflecting vanity 
 We live to lie and to betray 
 As we stand alone 
 Separated 
 We lick the blood 
 Of our tainted, shattered innocence 
 We are used to swallow the poison 
 To close our eyes as we descent 
 And lost our will in self-affliction 
 A fool's promise to break our heart 
 We are so sick to live this way 
 But we enjoy the lack of light 
 Walking in darkness 
 To run away 
 This blindness to cure our mind 
 From dreadful misery 
 We can't find the right belief 
 We can't find salvation 
 Frail, pathetic 
 We're unborn possibilities 
 Dissolved plasmaterial 
 We hide injuries deep inside 
 Afraid to show our wounds 
 We enjoy damnation 
 Disconnected, we have no goal or meaning 
 To lead our steps on this ground 
 Like mannequins, we're evolving 
 In the fields of a dead reality 
 Surrounded by our own delusions 
 Fractured and distorted to the core 
 We're searching the ecstasy of faith 
 In this masquerade called life 
 As we stand alone 
 Separated 
 And we welcome the fall 
 Softly in our arms we embrace 
 The disease called humanity 
 The genesis of tears and exquisite agony
########### Nomenklatura ###########
It's all around 
 A solid wall of lies 
 Designed on massive scales 
 Still, we endure and tolerate 
 Because we know we cannot stop the fall 
 Because we know it's getting worse day after day 
 Look at the world 
 We've got nothing to preserve 
 In this hollow life 
 We are broken deep within 
 We are destined 
 To be expendable products 
 To emulate cheap happiness 
 Like zealots, we imitate 
 We do our part 
 Secluded in vain deceptions 
 But soon glory fades 
 And there is nothing left but suffering 
 Our god is dead 
 Since we have been proclaimed divine 
 We have become but empty shells 
 No faith could feed or sustain us 
 We drift from place to place 
 Sunken in miserable dreams 
 We feel no love, we feel no hate 
 Then face the heart of destruction
########### A.E.O.N. ###########
I am the hollow face who controls vile delusion 
 and bends the souls of men 
 A kind and gentle voice to lure the Great Unwashed 
 All hail the age of sin 
 Like every traitor and willing pawns, I believe in my own lies 
 My exhortations, the words I preach are but systematic shifts 
 I am a fiction but in your heads 
 I only exist to entertain, to prevent masses to awake 
 Ignorance shall prevail 
 To lead and to fulfill the plebeians' desires, to corrupt and subvert 
 I need but to despise the very substance of truth 
 And define what is right 
 Like every traitor and willing pawns, I believe in my own lies 
 My exhortations, the words I preach are but systematic shifts 
 I am a fiction but in your heads 
 I only exist to entertain, to prevent masses to awake 
 Ignorance shall prevail 
 Like every traitor, I believe in my own lies 
 The words I preach are but systematic shifts 
 And you shall move on my very commands 
 Your shattered will is such a delight for me

########### Doomsday Party ###########
Doomsday party is starting out 
 Silhouettes flicking in dead lights 
 Ten thousand degrees Fahrenheit 
 We burst in solid centigrade 
 Heat transfer amplified 
 Kinetic figures all around 
 Dangerous girls in overdrive 
 Blood pressure widening our eyes 
 Ecstatic, polarized 
 Watch now, the sun i s fading away 
 And still the skyline is glowing in bright white 
 Let's drown in such an assembly 
 Let's yell until it all turn to black 
 (Doomsday party is starting out) 
 Testing endurance to defy the low performance 
 We deny all body failure, aiming high 
 Our breath intensified 
 And this is how we realize the tragic price of wasting time 
 It doesn't make sense if we die 
 And we'll know in the end if we truly lived 
 And this is how we realize the tragic price of wasting time 
 It doesn't make sense if we die 
 And we'll know in the end if we truly lived 
 We stop all motion for a while and bleed just to feel alive 
 Like a wave submerging us, we fall and shiver, 
 The welkin starts to ignite 
 And we know it won't last forever, it's nothing but a lie 
 A frail substitute for joy 
 Still, we want to define the line where life and death unite 
 Where night and day intertwine 
 We love and hate on fast forward 
 The momentum is getting wrong 
 Adrenaline is gasoline 
 The taste of dust is getting strong 
 Watch now, the sun is fa ding away 
 And still the skyline is glowing in bright white 
 Let's drown in such an assembly 
 Let's yell until it all turn to black 
 (Doomsday party is starting out) 
 And this is how we realize the tragic price of wasting time 
 It doesn't make sense if we die 
 And we'll know in the end if we truly lived 
 And this is how we realize the tragic price of wasting time 
 It doesn't make sense if we die

########### Human Black Box ###########
I used to struggle to change it all 
 To get rid of my misery 
 I used to believe it should be easy 
 To end all suffering 
 It always looks the same: 
 A ghastly place for pigs and mundane depravity 
 We support blasphemy and bless hypocrisy 
 To finally vote for destruction 
 Empires keep on falling 
 No one can stop 
 The earth to keep on turning by the way 
 No need to try to fight it 
 Just wait and see 
 The virtuous liars won't forever win 
 I ran full circle then realized 
 It was much better to take a seat 
 And watch this gruesome tragedy 
 With all its torment freaks 
 It always looks the same: 
 A ghastly place for pigs and mundane depravity 
 We support blasphemy and bless hypocrisy 
 To finally vote for destruction 
 Empires keep on falling 
 No one can stop 
 The earth to keep on turning by the way 
 No need to try to fight it 
 Just wait and see 
 The virtuous liars won't forever win 
 No matter our will-power or might 
 We have no mean to define the very course of fate 
 It's nothing but delusion: 
 No one can change what lies inside 
 No one can purge 
 The wrong side of mankind 
 We support blasphemy and bless hypocrisy 
 To finally vote for destruction 
 Empires keep on falling 
 No one can stop 
 The earth to keep on turning by the way 
 No need to try to fight it 
 Just wait and see 
 The virtuous liars are destined to die as well 
 Here lies the fairness of this life
########### Killjoy ###########
All what you stand for 
 This secure fortress of faithful convictions 
 Inspire me to disbelief 
 So full of yourself, you stare at me and say: 
 "Hey you killjoy, go away 
 Spare me your objections 
 Stop playing devil's advocate 
 Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake 
 Hey you killjoy, go away 
 Spare me your objections 
 Stop playing devil's advocate 
 Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake" 
 You know what's right or wrong 
 Jumping to conclusions, so likely to condemn 
 And take a single wise word for eternal truth 
 That's why you'll always say: 
 "Hey you killjoy, go away 
 Spare me your objections 
 Stop playing devil's advocate 
 Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake 
 Hey you killjoy, go away 
 Spare me your objections 
 Stop playing devil's advocate 
 Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake" 
 I just look for something you'll never grasp 
 A world neither black nor white, a wider definition 
 For nothing is downright pure or completely dark 
 Like myriads of variations for every shade of grey 
 Once I question your dual pattern 
 You can but whisper, 
 "Don't challenge me because I am the righteous one" 
 And try to conceal your confusion 
 You wish I'd walk away 
 So that your small, manicheist world would always stay the same 
 Your second-rate creed is such a dismay 
 "Hey you killjoy, go away 
 Spare me your objections 
 Stop playing devil's advocate 
 Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake 
 Hey you killjoy, go away 
 Spare me your objections 
 Stop playing devil's advocate 
 Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake"
########### I Am Ultraviolence ###########
I want to crush this world 
 Drenched in blood I'll rejoice 
 I'm prone to destroy all what is standing in my way 
 For I could confront the Creator itself 
 I'm not here to give in charity 
 When hate is a delicacy 
 I can't help thinking with a grin 
 Of your spine smashed under my feet 
 Why on earth should I restrain my inborn violence? 
 When I see them all looking for absurd excuses 
 To murder and slay, longing for senseless massacres 
 I won't try to hide such a radiant foolishness 
 I want to crush this world 
 Drenched in blood I'll rejoice 
 I'm prone to destroy all what is standing in my way 
 For I could confront the Creator itself 
 Why should I engage in this masquerade? 
 I don't wish to fuck around 
 And accept to face the worst of myself 
 Yes, I am Ultraviolence
########### Electronegative ###########
From the very beginning, I felt I couldn't live this way 
 To debase myself for the sake of your society 
 I blame your vain deceits for I see the plain hypocrisy 
 Of concealing my thoughts to gain security 
 I wasn't born into this world to endure your failures and faults 
 When life is bu t once given 
 I'd rather stand here on my own for I don't wish to trade my soul 
 I loathe this deficient civilization 
 When saints are just dead sinners amended and revised 
 No wonder why greed and humiliation 
 Become the norms to bound and regulate humankind 
 We welcome the reign of consternation 
 Hey, look at yourselves, crawling in filth and blatant lies 
 Still fooling yourselves, you run away until you die 
 I remain dazed and speechless in front of such inanity 
 Is it mere wishful thinking to ask for rationality? 
 To rate by proxy judgements, to never doubt authority 
 It doesn't sound like freewill but calculated slavery 
 Just as diamond and coal are made of similar matter 
 It is easy to confuse a swine in business suit from a man 
 Feels like I am the sole survivor of a vanished nation 
 Which knew that truth lays in this place no one dares to explore 
 When saints are just dead sinners amended and revised 
 No wonder why greed and humiliation 
 Become the norms to bound and regulate humankind 
 We welcome the reign of consternation 
 Lays in this place no one dares to explore
########### In The Cold Light ###########
I just close my eyes, and wait until the very end 
 To face this dreadful day 
 Hiding in this room and submerged by the glowing dawn 
 I can feel but regrets 
 I wish I could change it all, all the mistakes I've made 
 But I can't just forget the bitter taste of shame 
 I wish I were strong enough to deaden all the pain 
 Yet I can but descend and consume in despair 
 In the cold light 
 In the cold light of the day 
 In the cold light 
 In the cold light of the day my life is such a letdown 
 In the cold light 
 In the cold light 
 In the cold light of the day
########### Lucifer Effect ###########
Disillusioned yet fascinated 
 With bitter cruelty you deny the sanctity of flesh 
 Urging me to destroy 
 You say it's not a question of trust, the strongest don't lie 
 No matter if I have to bleed my own kind, it's all right 
 Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace 
 The downfall of the sun 
 My heart is frozen 
 Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace 
 The downfall of the sun 
 My wings are burning down 
 Oh doppelganger, I hear you in my head whispering 
 "What a joke! Their so-called faith and beliefs are but filth 
 Give up all tolerance 
 They loath lust and depravity but ignore their own sins 
 When zeitgeist extols raw pandemonium 
 Bring them hell" 
 Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace 
 The downfall of the sun 
 My heart is frozen 
 Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace 
 The downfall of the sun 
 My wings are burning down 
 "Prepare yourself to be deceived 
 By those you entrust your very dreams or darkest fears 
 To be double crossed" 
 There is no place for hope in you world 
 You love to deride my sustained endeavour to find a way 
 To stand still 
 Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace 
 The downfall of the sun 
 My heart is frozen 
 Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace 
 The downfall of the sun 
 My wings are burning down
########### Love Like Blood ###########
[Killing Joke Cover] 
 We must play our lives like soldiers in the field 
 But life is short I'm running faster all the time 
 Strength and beauty destined to decay 
 So cut the rose in full bloom 
 'til the fearless come and the act is done 
 A love like blood, a love like blood 
 Everyday through all frustration and despair 
 Love and hate fight with burning hearts 
 'til legends live and man is god again 
 (and self-preservation rules the day no more) 
 We must dream of promised lands and fields 
 That never fade in season 
 As we move towards no end we learn to die 
 Red tears are shed on grey
########### Meridian A.D. ###########
We believe to be eternal until we face the point of no return 
 All state of grace is transient 
 All shall die and turn to ashes and dust 
 Desacralized, desensitized 
 We chasing the light just wishing to live a little more 
 It's like a hole inside our chest 
 A clear cut bleeding, always open wide 
 To reach the apex of life is to walk in a vale of tears 
 Heavens still remain out of sight wherever we watch 
 To reach the apex of life is to walk in a vale of tears 
 We shine to finally dissolve in oblivion and be absolved through death 
 We've looked for strength through joy 
 Deprivation is all what we get 
 We've kept on trying to reach the stars 
 And deny mortality 
 We rise to better fall, condemned to rust and crumble for centuries 
 To behold the leftovers of our dreams now turn to smoking ruins 
 We ride the whirlwind of doom 
 A gigantic storm 
 Of cataclysmic and catastrophic proportions 
 It's like a hole inside our chest 
 A clear cut bleeding, always open wide 
 To reach the apex of life is to walk in a vale of tears 
 Heavens still remain out of sight wherever we watch 
 To reach the apex of life is to walk in a vale of tears 
 We shine to finally dissolve in oblivion and be absolved through death
########### From Zero To Nothing ###########
Day after day, recurring self-acting gestures 
 I can but feel this repetition and stand benumbed 
 I cannot run away 
 My existence in dissolution 
 How could I break this steady cycle to rise instead into light again 
 I have been waiting for the day when I could sort it out 
 But nothing ever changes 
 I'm wasting my own life 
 I am going from zero to nothing 
 I have been waiting for the day when I could sort it out 
 But nothing ever changes 
 I'm wasting my own life 
 And becoming what I have sworn to never be 
 When there is no way out 
 All just become insignificant 
 I can't breath 
 I can't sleep 
 Am I dead 
 No more faith 
 No more hopes 
 No more dreams 
 I have been waiting for the day when I could sort it out 
 But nothing ever changes 
 I'm wasting my own life 
 I am going from zero to nothing 
 I have been waiting for the day when I could sort i t out 
 But nothing ever changes 
 I'm wasting my own life 
 And becoming what I have sworn to never be

 Restructure your ego and filter the fluids of your body machinery 
 This obsolete frame starts to disintegrate now, conform to the current trend 
 Choose the latest fabric for improved content 
 You want it, you need, don’t wait 
 Let’s disgorge the poison of retrogression and reconstruct your carnal remains 
 Chorus: 
 Embrace the figure we’ve designed 
 Become a flawless model and behold your flesh quite amplified 
 Embrace the figure we’ve designed 
 Become a flawless model, a modern delight to free your mind 
 Slow death product for sale, we interrupt the decline with customized medicine

 Get more strength to enjoy your life with no fear of being left behind 
 To never catch a glimpse of contempt in their eyes or be brand as a castaway

 Repeat Chorus
########### No Wisdom Brings Solace ###########
I’ve tried to fight pessimism 
 To look for an explanation to the prime weakness we seem to convey: 
 A strong drive to destroy ourselves 
 All statements have turned out to conduct to a maze of suspect justifications 
 Encased between hermetic walls of incertitude 
 Axioms appear so contrived 
 And science, the paragon of devious crafts 
 I struggle to assimilate this fact: 
 No wisdom brings solace 
 Chorus: 
 I start to realize the limitations of my attempt to truly understand the misery of men 
 The more I look inside, the more I’ am prone to deride the basis of every creed: 
 To know is to be saved 
 I’m lost, standing at the crossroads with no means to decide on a better course 
 No choice appears convenient, no pathway predominates 
 Unsure to ever escape my posture of inflexible disbelief 
 I decide but to abandon this hunt for significance 
 Repeat second verse and chorus 
 Nothing is true, nothing is eternal, there’s no reward for steadfast belief 
 In a flawed system of assumption but a breakdown of cognition gears 
 To deprave the core of all knowledge and confer it the arrays of faith 
 Is to increase the prospect of oversight and absurdity 
 Repeat Chorus
########### The Line Of Least Resistance ###########
Prevaricator 
 There is no substance into your soul save pretense and disrespect 
 Obscene exposure 
 You trick your peers into sympathy using counterfeit emotionst 
 You believe no one can see through your disguise 
 Yet you make me want to turn my back on your pathetic treachery 
 Chorus: 
 Always choosing the easiest path 
 You seek to prevail with no sacrifice 
 Ready to walk over everyone 
 You reek of conceit and sickening pride 
 Pretentious fraudster 
 You deem yourself worthy of reverence, ever craving to be praised 
 Repeat second verse and chorus 
 You strive to deny your foolishness through delusions of great achievement 
 Trying to decrease your misery with blazing lies and random masquerades 
 Repeat second verse and chorus

########### God Is An Automaton ###########
We were blind and we couldn't conceive the color of blood 
 This crimson flood soaking the ground 
 We stare in shock as the world unveils its true features to us 
 You then exclaim "where is God now?" 
 Chorus: 
 You ask me "why do we forever feast on pain 
 And act like mindless fiends programmed for boundless rage? 
 The carnage never cease, the poison is never drained 
 For this, should we blame our Maker of everything divine?" 
 The virtuous dies as well as the sinful one 
 Death strikes all life, blind in its random ways 
 In essence, we contradict the conception of a watchful shaper 
 And still we consider being observed and closely monitored 
 Primitive we remain 
 We were devised to enjoy trials 
 The choice has never been ours 
 We are inclined to violence 
 Repeat Chorus
########### Hightech Versus Lowlife ###########
We're confined behind invisible barricades 
 A glyphic shroud of glorified lies 
 Kali Yuga – And we slowly turn into cowards 
 The excess of truth isolate us 
 Chorus: 
 Forsaken, dismayed 
 We were told to mask the void inside our deaden hearts in subtle ways 
 Substitute faceless 
 We're dissolved into a sea of gray, constrained to settle for decay 
 Evolving careless on treacherous heights 
 We weaver between detachment and fear 
 Kali Yuga – And we slowly turn into cowards 
 The excess of truth isolates us 
 Invalid notions dominate our will and judgment 
 We now become the waste of this world 
 Repeat chorus 
 "Surrender to the cold obliteration of your ego" 
 Desynchronized, forced to seclusion, we are bound with cruel precision 
 Kali Yuga – And slowly we turn into cowards 
 The excess of truth isolate us 
 Repeat chorus
########### Downfall Inc. ###########
To walk among the human herd 
 To see the mark of our degeneration 
 Stagnant and dazed, we but relent 
 To break the strain of our self-enforcing schemes 
 Now our future is tantamount to past 
 A dead-end race with a leaning for despise 
 Immobilism: our final goal 
 With corrupt bodies free to assume all control 
 Chorus: 
 To confuse truth and judgment 
 To observe the world with blinded eyes 
 To coronate intolerance 
 We only swallow changeless lies 
 We seem so eager to dissent 
 Yet through inaction we but approve each restraint 
 We keep on begging "please govern us" 
 Freedom's abridged, utopia is distrust 
 Repeat chorus 
 We are condemn to fail controlling our very lives 
 To endure through denial 
 We could let the world burn and watch each other die 
 Consternation made us unconcerned 
 With enforced discipline we but forfeit our very pride 
 We require low sustenance: to be kept entertained, to feel secure and feed 
 Deprivation is our single fear 
 Repeat chorus 
 How can we feel betrayed when we yield in front of any sign of change? 
 We keep on running away 
 We are far too scared to ever become self-contained
########### A Radiant Daybreak ###########
There was no light 
 I couldn’t find my very way 
 A dire frustration was all I could feel in my chest 
 For there was no joy in every moment I could spend 
 How could I reckon I trapped myself into a cage of misery? 
 My so-called strength had to be shattered 
 My beliefs were but a lie 
 It is so convenient to tint it all in deep tones of black 
 To live in fear is but meaningless 
 I shall face the source of my hopelessness 
 I just crave for suffering 
 Chorus: 
 I can see for the first time 
 And feel freed from the pain 
 Redeemed and disengaged 
 Oblivion is a just reward 
 A final slumber to end the divide 
 And awake purified 
 Why should I try to sustain such a barren state 
 When my whole condition is tantamount to emptiness? 
 I wish I could hide from this grim picture in my head 
 Yet I am locked up, lost in a maze of endless excruciation 
 I reach the height of isolation 
 There’s no need to revise or suspend the decision 
 For I discern but one conclusion 
 This gruesome existence has become an affliction I can’t withstand 
 Repeat second verse and chorus
########### Challenger ###########
Face down, this the way you taught me to abide 
 Down on my knees, I was just another servile bitch 
 I realized I was a whore begging for security 
 And such a coward, I‘d never have asked to be set free 
 Chorus: 
 Please tell me why should I disregard all the lies and become everything I despise 
 If I can find a meaning to this fearful life, I’ll become the enemy of mankind 
 What did you conjecture to arise from the ashes of my broken self? 
 An obedient drone just easy to bind? 
 I’m but the demon you’ve devised 
 Tremble, you bastards, I represent all that you dread 
 It’s so futile to think you can still control me 
 I’ve nothing to lose for you have tainted everything I prized 
 Whatever you try, revenge is mine 
 Repeat chorus 
 I shall wipe this burden out 
 Victorious I will stand above the mundane shame you’ve forcefully trained me in 
 I’ll concede nothing and never forget all your deeds of cruelty 
 Retribution is on the way, turning the war you’ve started into pure defeat 
 Repeat Chorus
########### Into The Blackest Light ###########
All hail your deceit 
 You, lord of all shattered hopes whispering words of fear 
 Termination is salvation 
 None of us is safe within your hands 
 Redemption with a bullet 
 You’re the prophet of limitless debasement 
 Chorus: 
 Here come the accuser obscuring the sky, intoxicating the soul 
 The serpent conspiring to engulf the world into the blackest light 
 Ouroborean seduction of foreknown doom 
 Your are death sovereign 
 Repeat second verse & chorus 
 We fall for your lies 
 We embrace nothingness 
 And decline as we can’t stand the weight of our guilt 
 Children of Despair, perdition is in our flesh 
 As we run toward fate 
 Repeat second verse & chorus
########### Destruction And Bliss ###########
I desecrate, predisposed to always re-engage 
 I deprecate, charging my words with bitterness and condemn 
 Chorus: 
 I’ll never let your insignificance, your substandard ego 
 Subverting my resolve and dedication 
 I’ll never take on your indecision and have no backbone 
 I always favor destruction and bliss 
 I’m disinclined to ever salute a defeat 
 To surrender or adopt a desolated stance 
 I’ll prevail 
 Repeat chorus 
 Existence is war, and joy an extravagant luxury 
 With no struggle we but decline in miserable parody of men 
 Why should I submit to your taste for mediocrity 
 When I crave for the most exquisite form of transcendence? 
 Why should I give up on my needs of brutality 
 When I yearn for an existence freed from all restricting bounds? 
 I refuse to spend my precious time here trying to abide 
 Repeat chorus

Stare if you stare 
 At the stars, the stars 
 They'll burn out and fall 
 In the fields that surround you 
 If you won't look up 
 If you keep your chin down 
 Raise the white flag 
 Just raise the white flag 
 If you're just gonna cave in 
 Just lay down and die 
 Just lay down and die 
 Trust me, trust me 
 I know you feel it deep down 
 Just breathe, just breathe 
 If you want it bad enough 
 It'll come to you 
 You're giving up all you are 
 Why do you need a thousand 
 Eyes pointing back at you? 
 Why do you want your 
 Name in the empty banner 
 Of those with naught to say? 
 I can see you slipping 
 I can see you slipping away again 
 I can see you drowning in the midnight tide 
 In the tide 
 I can see the sunlight 
 Pierce through the door 
 You are all the things 
 I choose to ignore 
 I am a starving man who does impossible things 
 And you can't see fire if you're standing in flames 
 Just raise the white flag 
 Trust me, trust me 
 I know you feel it deep down 
 Just breathe, 
 Just breathe 
 If you want it bad enough 
 It'll come to you 
 If you want it 
 It'll come to you 
 But you don't want it 
 I can see the sunlight 
 Pierce through the door 
 You are all the things 
 I choose to ignore 
 Trust me 
 Just raise the white flag 
 Just breathe 
 Just raise the white flag 
 Burn and fall
########### If He Dies, He Dies ###########
If you turn your head away 
 You will miss everything 
 (it's so sad) 
 It should mean everything 
 A love like this lost 
 And no remorse 
 "My son, it's just a burden of divorce" 
 Mark my words 
 I would drop everything 
 But a lie to the face 
 Is the ultimate way 
 Out of this 
 If you turn your head away 
 It might be easy to sleep 
 (but, it don't matter) 
 It festers underneath 
 The body just burns 
 Like open wounds 
 "My boy, there's just nothing left to do" 
 Like Oedipus 
 Like Laius 
 Like everything
########### Falling In Style ###########
Take it all slowly 
 I'm a slave to the scent of your skin 
 And you're so lovely 
 Under the touch of my tongue 
 And you bite your lips 
 When you make that face 
 Heaven between your hips 
 I stand at the pearly gates 
 I want everything you have to give to me 
 So just give it to me 
 And I wonder 
 What you might be thinking 
 Somewhere deep behind your eyes 
 When I lay you down 
 On the bed at night 
 And you look back at mine 
 Come to me late at night when no one's around 
 I am the falling rain and you are the ground.
########### Ivy & Wine ###########
Was born the son of the god of gods 
 Eaten alive 
 Saved in my father's thigh 
 Twice born to a mortal mother 
 Shot down with lightning bolts 
 With open eyes in the face of glory 
 Torn apart 
 Limb from limb 
 Payback is a mother fucker 
 Underneath the spell 
 Of the semi-precious 
 Holy god of ceremonial madness 
 Cast into the charm 
 Of the halfway diety 
 Holy god of divine ecstasy 
 Where is the new wine? 
 Dying on the vine 
 I want roses in my garden 
 I cam back to the motherland 
 To prove I am who they say I am 
 The moonstruck women 
 And elder statesmen 
 Await 
 Deep in the woods 
 Where you say you came from
########### Prelude For A Ghost ###########
And I can feel it 
 Your eyes like rapid rivers 
 Move over me 
 Searching me 
 Like I can deal with it 
 Like I can take in everything 
 And lose you too...
########### All Along ###########
I am no lover 
 I am no faultless man 
 Carry me closer 
 To where we once began 
 Because the days now burn 
 Like fresh lit cigarettes 
 You pull me closer 
 With perfect spinnerets 
 I feel the seams about to split 
 But you're wide-eyed and bushy-tailed 
 I won't be here forever 
 And I can feel it 
 Your eyes like rapid rivers 
 Move over me 
 Searching me 
 Like I can deal with it 
 Like I can take in everything 
 And lose you too 
 (I know you can) 
 I am no fucking lover 
 I'm just a burning bridge 
 These holy rollers 
 They just don't stand a chance 
 Because you speak so slow 
 In secret alphabets 
 You walk so tall now 
 On slender minarets 
 I am just a ghost
########### She Is Well And Nothing Can Be Ill ###########
Oh my, my, my 
 My lonely love 
 Just rest your mind 
 And your soft green eyes 
 Those dirty red inflections 
 Are just burned into my brain 
 Those taunts from lesser loves 
 I push them all away 
 This is enough to kill me 
 (Just breathe deep) 
 It's just enough to run away 
 (Turn the other cheek) 
 I know it gets hard 
 They're out to get me 
 But, you'll miss the greatest part 
 I will do everything I can 
 I know you know 
 What I would give 
 To see that road 
 It leads to this 
 The cavern that we sleep in 
 And those perfect little trains 
 The lights that hang above us 
 And your candied leaves 
 The scent you gave to me 
 It's all that's saving me
########### Counting Sheep ###########
Well don't cry your eyes out 
 On the ballroom floor 
 We're all murderers 
 In a martyr's world 
 So don't cry your eyes out 
 We're only lonely 
 When we're half awake 
 And it's only a matter of time 
 This pillow talk illusion 
 It feels so real 
 Just get me out of here 
 All you talk about is counting sheep 
 Anything to fall asleep 
 No light behind the window 
 Time just builds 
 Slowly kills 
 We don't give a fuck who you are 
 This time of night 
 Miserable empty arms 
 They tend to put up a fight 
 So when you open your mouth 
 You better bite your tongue 
 And God knows 
 You're not the only one
########### Memorandum ###########
You're not gonna like this 
 The way it comes across the eye 
 I'm not gonna fight you 
 I'm just gonna open your mind 
 You'll catch your death out there 
 If you don't come inside 
 There's no need 
 To run and hide 
 None the wiser 
 Only real eyes realize 
 What the lies are 
 Realize from the start 
 What the lies are 
 I'm torn up inside from the sight of it 
 Young man, I'm a messenger 
 Yeah, a message that burns so slow 
 But, oh what a breathtaking scene 
 I'm not gonna fight you for it 
 I'm not gonna fight you 
 There's no need 
 To run and hide 
 I seldom dream of you 
 A dream of you would shroud my perfect view 
 I see clearly now 
 Shine so vibrantly 
 And stretch across the sky 
 As man, 
 We're just 
 Pacing back and forth 
 And walk between 
 The memories that hang 
 Across the earth 
 I see clearly now
########### From May To Now ###########
After all this time 
 It starts to feel like years inside 
 It gets to be just like a day on avalanche 
 These words are a slow romance 
 I don't believe you would say 
 Anything to lead me astray 
 Three thousand miles from here 
 And nothing helps bring it near 
 I know you can't understand 
 My empty hands 
 I know it's times like these 
 These things just make you insane 
 I'm on the front porch with my bags packed 
 And where is my chariot? 
 I don't need golden wings 
 Just something that can make me free 
 Everything you say 
 It always adds another day 
 We are all soldiers with loaded guns 
 Ready for war

 Is any of this enough?

I can see for miles across this concrete wasteland 
 From the tops of the trees and to the seas 
 I can see for miles across this concrete wasteland 
 From the tops of the trees and to the seas 
 They have all grayed with age 
 The broken will of man has become routine and has stretched beyond the horizon 
 They have all grayed with age 
 The broken will of man has become routine and has stretched beyond the horizon 
 A long path 
 A long path that was once a destiny 
 The city streets are a maze in our minds 
 That was once a destiny 
 The city streets are a maze in our minds, our minds 
 A never-ending puzzle lost in a dream 
 I pray for those who walk these streets 
 That they may see the tops of the towers 
 And expand their conscience 
 I beg they open up their eyes and bear witness to this crumbling city 
 But some things may never change 
 Some things may never change 
 The sun sets on the metropolis as only streetlights 
 Illuminate its collapse 
 Mesmerized by illuminated skies 
 The towers linger as if watching us fall 
 The sun sets on the metropolis 
 As only streetlights illuminate its collapse 
 I beg they open up their eyes 
 And bear witness to this crumbling city 
 But some things may never change 
 Some things always stay the same 
 But some things may never change 
 Mesmerized by illuminated skies

I've seen the eyes of men turn from blue to gray

 Truth is something lost beyond the grave 
 Corrupted thoughts now hold us in chains 
 This is our chance, our chance to rise 
 Before the building crumbles, before we die 
 Hand in hand, join us together this last second 
 Let's reconcile what was this place 
 And rebuild the bridge that joins us 
 We're reaching out and hoping for something to hold us still 
 Searching for something, an answer to nothing to make this clear 
 Your life meant more to me than this world in its entirety 
 Your life meant more to me than this world in its entirety 
 Before the building crumbles, before we die 
 Hand in hand, join us together this last second 
 Hand in hand, join us together, one last time 
 Join us together, one last time 
 One last time, join us 
 Hand in hand forever

I am a spirit divested of human capabilities. 
 I am a spirit. 
 There are masses alike, hiding in plain sight. 
 Open your eyes. 
 You can not perceive me. 
 Closed off to the senses that exist in your reality. There is a ghost in all of us. 
 There are many that try to open their minds, deciphering the intellect of spiritual design. 
 Beyond our world. 
 White Noise. 
 Too many have come before you and failed, causing the constant scientific derail. 
 Beyond our world. 
 Open up your eyes. 
 Beyond our world lie parallels between our dimensions. Images Unseen. 
 What is this entity and what does it want of me? 
 It has a hold on my soul, I can't get free. 
 So many that try to open their minds, deciphering the intellect of spiritual design. 
 Beyond our world. 
 White Noise. 
 Open your eyes, you can't perceive me. 
 Closed off to the senses that exist in your reality. Beyond our world. 
 I will abandon myself. 
 What is this entity and what does it want of me? 
 It has a hold on my soul, I can't get free. 
 Am I allowing my atrophy, or can I stop this from happening? 
 I will abandon myself. 
 I will abandon myself. 
 Rebirth in a dimension unknown, unseen. 
 I will leave my body. 
 Still small voices are resonating. 
 Beyond our world lie parallels between our dimensions. Images Unseen. 
 Amongst the dead sound frequency, there is a pulse. Images Unseen.
########### Seven ###########
Children of Anu 
 A son born of Tiamat and Abzu 
 His mother's dissected corpse 
 Carefully arranged to create the universe 
 Marduk, patron god of Babylon 
 Marduk is aging, a city in decline 
 Anu impregnates the earth, birth seven gods 
 Decree their destinies to serve as the weapons of Erra 
 The ruins of a city, the vicious Sebitti 
 Fear, children of Anu, lay low, living things 
 Fill their hearts with dragon's venom 
 Devastation to Marduk and Babylon 
 Ishum lights the way 
 Through the darkened city streets 
 His body illuminates 
 Ignite like Gerra in the wake of Erra 
 They decimate, devastate a city in decline 
 May they lay low living things 
 The Igigi will glorify your name 
 Mountain peaks bow their heads in terror 
 The gods, your fathers, praise your valor 
 Kings kneel beneath your feet 
 Countries bring you their tribute, demons flee 
 Rolling seas, hear and stir up 
 People are frightened into controlling the noise 
 Ishum lights the way 
 Through the darkened city streets 
 His body illuminates 
 Ignite like Gerra in the wake of Erra 
 They decimate, devastate a city in decline 
 Devastate the city of the gods 
 Children of Anu, lay low, leaving the things 
 The Igigi will glorify your name 
 The gods, your fathers, will praise your valor
########### Vaalbara ###########
You've been torn between opposing forces 
 The drag of this contingent event is unbearable because of these tectonics that shift beneath your feet 
 It is arrogant to disregard and foolish to turn away 
 An ignorant bliss does not exist in a reality that ceases to live 
 You are falling forward while falling back 
 Too adorned with blemishes that hide the facts 
 This world around you is drifting through an ocean that despises you 
 And the continent is not content with being connected 
 You're relative 
 Until torn and tattered, departed and disgraced 
 The life you contrive will have no place 
 Beget and begotten, your will erased 
 Its geography has been razed 
 You are falling forward while falling back 
 Too adorned with blemishes that hide the facts 
 You've been torn between opposing forces 
 Until torn and tattered, departed and disgraced 
 The life you contrive will have no place 
 Left with only soil beneath your fingernails from the potter's field 
 Six feet under lay the vaulted graves of bodies that didn't yield 
 This world around you is drifting through an ocean that despises you 
 And the continent is not content with being connected 
 You're relative 
 Six feet under lay the vaulted graves of bodies that did not yield
########### Luminesce ###########
I'm spiraling out of control 
 So you illuminate a clean slate 
 You're lifting the weight that's diluting inspiration 
 I woke with the sun in my face, mountains by my side 
 The desert air pulling the breath from my lungs 
 I've been making my way through a barren landscape 
 Littered with remains of past lives 
 And shadows of the scavengers 
 World passing by 
 Leaving traces of shapes, blurring into memory 
 Dreaming of terrain that sustains 
 I wake up, wake up 
 I'm lying parallel with the landscape 
 There will always be a void to be filled 
 Illuminate a clean slate 
 Keep lifting the weight that is diluting inspiration 
 There will always be a void with no permanent fix 
 Shifting of puzzle pieces to simulate a whole 
 World passing by 
 Leaving traces of shapes, blurring into memory 
 Dreaming of terrain that sustains 
 I wake up, wake up 
 To a world that's unfamiliar 
 We leave and then we go back like we never left home 
 (Like we never left) 
 We go back like we never left home 
 (Left home) 
 When will we wake the fuck up? 
 Parallel with the landscape 
 I lie awake with diminishing desire to always seek escape 
 From a home where I feel sound and safe 
 World passing by 
 Leaving traces of shapes, blurring into memory 
 Dreaming of terrain that sustains 
 I wake up, wake up 
 (When will we all wake up?) 
 Diminished desire to always seek escape 
 To a world that's unfamiliar 
 We leave and then we go back like we never left home 
 (Like we never left) 
 We go back like we never left home 
 (Left home)
########### Irreversible ###########
Irreversible 
 A sequence of events unfolding in reverse 
 A sting better stimulated when revealing tragedy first 
 Reverse perception reversing imperfection 
 Be aware of the darkness that lies 
 Beneath the surface of contrived pleasantries 
 Be aware so as to always hold tighter 
 Speak softer, there is no failsafe 
 So now you know there is no failsafe 
 So cut ties with the dead weight that is dragging you below 
 Pull me closer 
 When silence consumes you, I'll speak words softer 
 Sinking slower 
 We stimulate the sting, restrain 
 I'm not giving up, I'm giving in to the touch 
 Of every inch of your sea salt skin 
 But you set me ablaze and spread me out 
 With waves in the ocean, with every trace of doubt 
 Black me out 
 Don't stimulate the sting 
 Don't let the wrong choices repeat themselves 
 Don't stimulate the sting of irreversible emptiness 
 Pull me in close, pull me in close 
 It's in the empty spaces that we find ourselves 
 It's in the empty spaces, reaching out and grasping 
 Searching for what we need to find who we are 
 Who we are 
 There is no failsafe, it's what keeps me hanging on 
 To what you are to me, you're what keeps me hanging on 
 I'm not giving up, I'm giving in 
 So let's begin again 
 (Let's begin again) 
 Pull me closer 
 When silence consumes you, I'll speak words softer 
 Sinking slower 
 We stimulate the sting, restrain 
 Pulling you closer 'cause after all 
 You're pulling back farther 
 And we're sinking slower 
 We stimulate the sting, restrain 
 Don't turn your back on her 
 Let her look you right in the eyes, you coward 
 Don't stimulate the sting 
 Don't let the wrong choices repeat themselves 
 Don't stimulate the sting of irreversible emptiness
########### Skyline ###########
Cityscape skeletons taking shape and growing skin 
 Layer and layer is peeled away 
 (Exhausted) 
 From the repetition of always needing to rebuild 
 Worn down faces in colorful barren places 
 City lights and skylines guiding home our wandering minds 
 Tucking us into tortoiseshells 
 Suppressing the outside sounds of relentless consciousness 
 Where is contemplative terrain that sleeps with the setting sun? 
 This nocturnal apathy binging on shadow and smoke 
 Endlessly coming undone 
 When the ground falls out, who will take my hand? 
 When things fall apart, who will take my hand? 
 I never thought that I could withstand 
 Falling short when I'm a broken man 
 You never knew how much I meant it in love 
 Every night I'm beside you weeks away when you're sleeping alone 
 Did you ever know how much I meant it? 
 Millions of tiny pieces looking in on themselves 
 Reflected in the water, unaware of each other 
 Every piece could find its place back in the puzzle 
 What was one is shattered into many and longs to be whole again 
 But nothing ever fits quite the same in the end 
 I never thought that I could withstand 
 Falling short when I'm a broken man 
 You never knew how much I meant it in love 
 I never thought that I could withstand 
 Falling short when I'm a broken man 
 You never knew how much I meant it in love 
 Every night I'm beside you weeks away when you're sleeping alone 
 Did you ever know how much I meant it? 
 When the ground falls out, who will take my hand? 
 When things fall apart, who will take my hand?
########### Hourglass ###########
I've watched a lot of things crumble 
 (In my hands) 
 Falling through my fingers like grains of sand 
 When the hourglass tips over 
 (On its side) 
 Does it create infinite moments or leave us trapped in time? 
 Loath, disdain, pity, regret consume me and I shut down 
 Dissolving internally with no silver linings to any clouds 
 I disassociate with everything I know 
 Drowning out, losing control 
 My detachment permeates to everything I know 
 Refill the sands and balance the scales or let me go 
 I'm becoming everything that I defied 
 Withdrawn emotions, I've built a shell and I live inside 
 I disassociate with everything I know 
 Drowning out, losing control 
 My detachment permeates to everything I know 
 Drowning out, losing control 
 Losing control 
 I'm becoming everything I defied 
 Slowly withering, there seems to be no way out 
 Refill the sands, balance the scales or let me go 
 Loath, disdain, pity, regret consume me and I shut down 
 (I'm shutting down) 
 Dissolving internally with no silver linings to any fucking clouds 
 I disassociate with everything I know 
 Drowning out, losing control 
 My detachment permeates to everything I know 
 Drowning out, losing control 
 Losing control
########### Orchid ###########
As our world oscillates to shake the weak remains 
 Show your strength, resist all temptation 
 To follow illusions expressed with safety 
 Open up your wings, and fly to sanctuary 
 Trying to dislocate from talk and scoff 
 That shows them what they are 
 Murderous words might as well been sent by a bullet 
 Keep your eyes closed and your fingers crossed 
 Till our paths meet, I'll try to lead the way 
 Take me back to who I was back then 
 I'll show you what life means to me again 
 Maybe in due time, you'll let me in 
 I'll lift the weight so you don't have to fall 
 Brother, when every muscle strains 
 I will lift the weight for you 
 Sister, if you just call my name 
 I will lift the weight for you 
 You can't find the strength, your eyes lose resistance 
 I will lift the weight for you 
 I wasn't there for the darkest of hallways 
 The longest of paths 
 A crazy train going off the tracks 
 Catch my fall when the earth shakes 
 Catch my fall when the earth shakes 
 Take me back to who I was back then 
 An honest man and a faithful friend 
 I'll show you what life means to me again 
 Maybe in due time, you'll let me in 
 Take me back to who I was back then 
 An honest man and a faithful friend 
 I'll show you what life means to me again 
 Maybe in due time, you'll let me in 
 'Cause there is so much left to amend 
 Brother, when every muscle strains 
 I will lift the weight for you 
 Sister, if you just call my name 
 I will lift the weight for you 
 You can't find the strength, your eyes lose resistance 
 I will lift the weight for you 
 I know that we've changed but this remains consistent 
 I will lift the weight for you 
 We pick at the scab, it bleeds and it bleeds 
 Extending the healing to keep us contained 
 A weak doppelgänger, the bastard one 
 I'll leave you behind and continue on
########### Drift ###########
Take a breath, enter the unknown 
 Watch your step, it's an escape to the world anew 
 Flood yourself with colors and senses on overload 
 Sink inside yourself, watch out for the bottom 
 Because there's no turning back once it​ takes control 
 And you prefer this new creation 
 The pain exits slowly and there's nothing left but bliss 
 Floating out at sea, away from reality 
 It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind 
 I'm drifting in and out of ocean dreams 
 It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind 
 My pulse is sent into overdrive 
 Trying to calm my nerves with an unnatural catalyst 
 Agitator, wave maker, incendiary, excite my life 
 Floating out at sea, away from reality 
 It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind 
 I'm drifting in and out of ocean dreams 
 It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind 
 Drifting in and out 
 Drifting in and out of reality 
 Drifting in and out 
 (Of ocean dreams) 
 Drifting in and out of reality 
 Drifting in and out 
 (Let your mind drift)
########### Sleeper ###########
Tossed around the idea of stepping off the edge 
 Hoping my fall lands into a familiar place 
 A familiar face: can we leave this space? 
 It reminds me of all my mistakes, all my mistakes 
 Bite my tongue, vision spins 
 Living life from the cutter's skin 
 Sent to be an ungrateful son 
 Can't you see my breath is gone? 
 Bury my head to hide from reality 
 I'll make a new name for myself, I'm on my own 
 I just hope I have the strength to move and show fortitude 
 Bite my tongue, vision spins 
 Living life from the cutter's skin 
 Sent to be an ungrateful son 
 Can't you see my breath is gone? 
 Just let me sleep tonight 
 Tonight, I only feel safe inside 
 Shadows cast and dance slick, these walls expand quick 
 With every strike, I shudder at the wake 
 Rippling through my drifting mind 
 What if I knew the journey this whole time? 
 Just let me sleep tonight 
 Tonight, I only feel safe inside 
 I only feel safe inside 
 Just let me sleep tonight 
 So I need to be saved; do I want to be? 
 I don't want to be the shell of what these people see 
 Just let me sleep tonight 
 Tonight, I only feel safe inside 
 I only feel safe inside 
 Just let me sleep tonight
########### Continuum ###########
This moment's passing breeze 
 Feels like your tender breath I used to know so well 
 The silence is crushing 
 The white noise that used to call my name 
 Break down and all my thoughts have escaped me 
 Except for all the things that show me your face 
 Ever so brightly 
 Poised through a lie that still remains 
 Such little left that I can say 
 With authenticity, so I 
 Close my eyes and I can hear you calling from behind 
 Close my eyes, I swear I feel you crawling towards the light 
 Tell me the words that will keep you close 
 Poor soul, heart full, temperature fluctuates 
 To later be buried in my own personal graveyard 
 Of emotion and past mistakes 
 Close my eyes and I can hear you calling from behind 
 Close my eyes, I swear I feel you crawling towards the light 
 My skin is turning white, watching your soul in flight 
 Close my eyes, I swear I feel you crawling towards the light 
 The bloody beat, beat, beat in my chest 
 The coldest chill creeping up my neck 
 Tell me the words that will keep you close 
 Life won't feel the same anymore 'cause you're gone 
 And it's far too late to say the things I'm sorry for 
 Five fingers gripping the glass 
 For the last time I'd hope to say 
 Three nights with no separation 
 I know too well there's one more thing I could have said 
 Life won't feel the same anymore 'cause you're gone 
 And it's far too late to say the things I'm sorry for 
 I can't take it back, I can't bring you back 
 Life won't feel the same anymore 'cause you're gone 
 (And I'm holding on)
########### Safehaven ###########
Every memory recalled is an origin that we've altered 
 Broken promises to another man's daughter 
 Endless walk down a dead road as our last breaths begin to falter 
 We lend our weight to the backs of our broken fathers 
 Featherweight boy in his arms, every night he weeps 
 Constantly drifting in and out of sleep 
 Palm against transparent skin, fingers tracing ribs 
 Reassurance that the heart was still beating 
 At the helm of death, every day like clockwork 
 Restless nights with trembling hands against transparent skin 
 But they carry on because survival is not a dead end 
 Whether or not the world is withered away 
 (Withered away) 
 We are each other's world entirely 
 Whether or not the world is withered away 
 (Withered away) 
 We are ever, we are evermore 
 Lost ghosts around every corner, on every charred sidewalk 
 Still trudging through the ash of an endless walk 
 With bodies cold and weightless, resilient of death in life 
 Resilient of death in death, they walk on 
 Dreaming of a safe haven at the end of the road 
 An unstable safety, the only kind we've ever known 
 Oh, we walk along, dreaming of a safe haven 
 Oh, we walk along at the end of the road 
 Our legs will never fail, we'll carry on 
 And I swear to you 
 Whether or not the world is withered away 
 (Withered away) 
 We are each other's world entirely 
 Whether or not the world is withered away 
 (Withered away) 
 We are ever, we are evermore 
 Oh, we walk along, dreaming of a safe haven 
 Oh, we walk along at the end of the road 
 Resilient of death because life is not a dead end 
 Whether or not the world is withered away 
 We are each other's world entirely 
 Whether or not the world is withered away 
 We are ever, we are evermore 
 We are evermore 
 We are ever, we are evermore
########### The Hypnotist ###########
These black holes in my hands, so endless 
 Swallowing everything that I see 
 This open wound in my chest, so endless 
 Devour me 
 Shameful desire spreading like a wildfire 
 You've seen it yourself, devour me 
 Sickening shameful desire spreading like a wildfire 
 You've seen it yourself, you've seen it yourself 
 My body's breaking down 
 My spirit is submissive 
 Broken memories consume me 
 Broken memories consume me 
 Distance grows between you and I, discord unforeseen 
 Won't you just say what you mean for the last time? 
 Say what you mean tonight 
 This open wound in my chest, so endless 
 Is rapidly expanding 
 Broken memories consume me 
 Time slips away and we're left here 
 Writing off the memories we saved 
 I go far away and leave you here 
 Writing off the memories we saved 
 Return to me, reconciled when we collide 
 Return to me with full force in every stride 
 Life falls fast as time slips away 
 Return to me, reconciled when we collide 
 Sometimes our darker side grows hypnotizing 
 Pleading for release 
 Consciences out of touch with love subsiding 
 Needing set free 
 We're writing off memories as time slips away 
 (Time slips away) 
 Welcome to the free world 
 With consciences out of touch 
 You know when a love so full fades away 
 You ponder things lost between time and this hollow space 
 You ponder what you can't replace and your mind recalls her face

Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water 
 Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea 
 Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently 
 By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee 
 Every time I look into the Holy Book I want to tremble (tremble) 
 Or when I read about the part where the carpenter cleared the temple (temple) 
 For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellas than what I profess to be 
 And it causes me shame to know we're not the people we should be 
 So, put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water 
 Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea 
 Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently 
 By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee 
 My mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven 
 She said, "there'll come a time when there'll probably be room in heaven" 
 But I'm feeling kinda guilty 'bout the number of times to do what we must do 
 But we forget what he said, then we figure that he'll still make room 
 So, you gotta put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water 
 Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea 
 Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently 
 By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee 
 Everybody come along 
 Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water

 Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea

########### The Girl Next Door Is Always Screaming ###########
amy, sweet lewd amy... the way she moans, it's so obscene. 
 whether she's crying or complaining, 
 and the way she's getting beaten, it's almost arousing. 
 I cannot differ the sounds anymore, 
 they all seem like a relentless buzzing discomfort. 
 f**k this treacherous imagination of mine, 
 if you'd only knew the complexity of the scenarios emerging from there. 
 it feels like a bad soap-opera, 
 yet you cannot help yourself from watching the next episode. 
 she must be so beautiful, 
 I guess that is why I hate her and her voice that much. 
 the mystery in itself, of her real self, is far more interesting than knowing. 
 introspection, yes I do fear the return of the ever-questioning process. 
 it has forced me to review most of the basics concerning females. 
 I hear them, over and over again, throughout the night. 
 I don't remember the last time I slept, 
 and... and I'm not feeling well, here, 
 alone with my thoughts... staring at a blank wall. 
 battered and bruised, bleeding on the floor. 
 worthless piece of meat. I know she's crushed. 
 but I am useless, unable to save her, and maybe I don't want to. 
 oh how I beg for complete silence...
########### The Bud Dwyer Effect ###########

 I'm indulging myself in a strategic advance, orchestrated by the enemy. 
 it dwells deep, yet grows strong, within... 
 (Am I working against myself? well am I?) 
 everything dreadful happening, imagine how I should feel, 
 when realizing that it was planned, 
 from a beginning that I don't even recall, 
 you might call this a tragedy, 
 seems more to me like simple standard habits. 
 wishing to be finally saved, 
 waiting for something/someone that would order me to follow 
 a certain purpose with both convictions and deviations. 
 if you'd only knew how... I'm tired of your paintings. 
 your bold landscapes sucks and have ceased to amaze me long ago. 
 be a pal and let me add a fantasy of mine, abstraction. 
 of scarlet and red pure... so pure. 
 are there any written rules related to simplicity (of actions, of thoughts...) 
 I guess not. 
 so how come your judging? 
 you won't the day that it will end, 
 drenched in vital fluids (.357) 
 as you are forced to witness the spontaneity of the events.

########### Substantial Guilt Vs. The Irony Of Enjoying ###########
and I lay numb, waiting for something worst to happen. 
 sweet innocence, it happened so suddenly. 
 she crossed my path on the way to nothingness, 
 I knew that was encountering an angel of purity 
 and in the process I've quickly understood that I don't deserve her, 
 none of us, humans, do. 
 beholding such a fatality leave you empty with bitter grief. 
 life seem to be tarnished and sour, raped in its very essence, 
 but sorrow is rapidly replaced by frustration, envy and despair. 
 dressed in white, a child alone, 
 so fragile and beautiful has dawn, 
 to hold her close was exhilarating in a most vicious way. 
 I felt so weak, yet empowered somehow. 
 One thing leading to another, I knew then, 
 that if I could not experience nor possess purity, 
 I would at least try to grasp it and choke the life out of it. 
 and I did, oh why, I don't know but I did... violently, 
 I've pummelled her face with my bare fists till she became awfully deformed, 
 bleeding and dying, all twisted in terror... 
 I, I, I have forcefully replaced every missing teeth in her mouth 
 by razor sharp shards of glass, 
 slowly inserting every piece of glass in the little one's gum. 
 why was I laughing? 
 I guess that is my art, to inflict upon purity the only thing I can give, 
 and unfortunately it's not love. 
 I should've feel guilty, I know, but it simply didn't occur. 
 (As I am unable to put the knife trough my own flesh anymore...)

 solaris is dimly shinning, 
 and is desperately trying to pierce the pale wall of mist, blurring his vision. 
 I cannot exactly describe this weariness in which I am drowning, 
 yes... it is possibly the darkest day that I've ever experienced. 
 yet misery don't seem so heavy anymore, 
 it seems more or less constant and relentless? 
 sorrow slips over me like rain usually does on soft skin... 
 cold as marble stone. 
 I'm overwhelmed by this sudden state of neutrality... of weightlessness. 
 I am lost trough an emptied heaven... 
 I sense that I am no longer alone in my foreign journey, 
 around me they swirl silently, those little aerial beings. 
 little angels of demise whispering music to my hear, exquisite yet inaudible. 
 I cannot understand a thing of what they're saying. 
 silence is the beauty that I behold, profound has an eternal slumber, 
 holding the strangest of dreams. 
 blindly I follow, for I am simply drugged by their livid smile. 
 I cannot stop... not now, so close... 
 (to the unknown) frost is gradually spreading trough my veins, 
 and toward my darkened heart, 
 crystallizing my blood after its passage... 
 luring me far away from what I might have once called: home... 
 those little spirits are slowly killing me, with purity. 
 I know now that they want me to die an horrible death, 
 has much has anyone else. 
 and frankly, I don't really care anymore...

 the density of the air was tangible today, it was way too heavy for me. 
 I woke up an hour earlier, 
 I am eager to amaze myself for all the things that I could do, 
 but most definitely won't, during this loose hour. 
 another day, predictably mundane, 
 another scratch on the surface of the 7" ep, 
 that is my life... it keeps on bouncing! 
 (all around, back and forth) 
 my "columbian (medium roast) full-bodied with rich flavor" coffee. 
 expensively tasted like sewer water today. 
 the "normal and subtle" sour taste couldn't be sweeten at all, 
 no matter how I sugared it. 
 how many times have I wonder if this taste wasn't impregnated in my mouth? 
 and once again (and as always), 
 I'm having a delightful conversation. 
 with the refrigerator by my side, he's always complaining, 
 I'm used to his point of views now, his constant mumbling... 
 drastically sarcastic, almost has bitter has my coffee. 
 he seems to have an opinion about everything? 
 an instant passed, then I remembered that I have an optic sense. 
 ah, there its is, my 4th floor morning-view of a sunlit back alley. 
 down there, an ant-like man is wandering, 
 nervously looking all around, back and forth. 
 and once the tension is gone, sure that nobody's there 
 (Unaware that he's being stared at), 
 unzip his pants and ungraciously expose himself 
 in order to piss his way trough my alley. 
 I am almost has relieved as he, once he's finished, 
 but for obvious different reasons. 
 happily confined, thoroughly hollow and unfulfilled. 
 I think I'll go back to sleep. 
 (Is it possible to be sea-sick on firm ground?)
########### The Girl Nextdoor Is Always Screaming... ###########
amy, sweet lewd amy... the way she moans, it's so obscene. 
 whether she's crying or complaining, 
 and the way she's getting beaten, it's almost arousing. 
 I cannot differ the sounds anymore, 
 they all seem like a relentless buzzing discomfort. 
 fuck this treacherous imagination of mine, 
 if you'd only knew the complexity of the scenarios emerging from there. 
 it feels like a bad soap-opera, 
 yet you cannot help yourself from watching the next episode. 
 she must be so beautiful, 
 I guess that is why I hate her and her voice that much. 
 the mystery in itself, of her real self, is far more interesting than knowing. 
 introspection, yes I do fear the return of the ever-questioning process. 
 it has forced me to review most of the basics concerning females. 
 I hear them, over and over again, throughout the night. 
 I don't remember the last time I slept, 
 and... and I'm not feeling well, here, 
 alone with my thoughts... staring at a blank wall. 
 battered and bruised, bleeding on the floor. 
 worthless piece of meat. I know she's crushed. 
 but I am useless, unable to save her, and maybe I don't want to. 
 oh how I beg for complete silence...
########### A Regular Dose Of Azure ###########
as a flower, she bloomed once her wrists were opened. 
 I remember her scent, intoxicating. 
 my communication with her was clearly enhance. 
 but her's was quickly fading, discontinued and frail. 
 her eyes reflected an hopeless apprehension, 
 for a compassionate smile, a misplaced melancholy. 
 liquid-azure, she stared at me... 
 like when we used to drink too much cocktails on sunday's afternoon... 
 I remember her heart-breaking smile, now beautifully distorted. 
 agony and orgasms combined, I swear. 
 don't worry girl, everythin' is going to be alright. 
 can't wait till she sober up and realise what is truly happening. 
 she seem gently desperate, numb and on the verge of collapsing. 
 but that... I cannot allow. this is a test 
 and I couldn't get more sentimental. 
 her pulse, slowing down, foreshadowing a very long and quiet season, 
 of dreamlike serenity... 
 I'll miss her so much 
 (Ether died as a martyr, unknown, in a secluded asylum)
########### Play Dead... And I'll Play Along ###########
I was sitting alone again, 
 (in a remote corner lit only by the frail dance of dying candles) 
 Drinking, of course, when Perdition the Elder sat down. 
 He had that weird smile upon his face 
 And that fiery look he has when he's about to initiate a somewhat unusual conversation; 
 "I am but a Plague..." he began to say, 
 "I have studied Locustism for years now. 
 I am like you, y'know. Human, a useless vermin?" 
 He had a point, but still I felt like I had to reply something... anything, 
 But he cut me right off; 
 "...A slight change of posture, a loud muted noise from Above, 
 And then came an Ego that was to be our own downfall..." he paused and stared at me for a moment. 
 Thats when he suddenly pulled this huge magnum from his jacket 
 And forced the wretched thing into my mouth, saying; 
 "I am giving you a choice: Kill yourself or someone you love..." 
 "The cold sensation of your clenched teetchs around a gun barrel 
 And the warm salty taste of your own tears... thats my gift to you." 
 "Play dead and I'll play along son..."
########### O.A.S.D ###########
A quick snap and that was it... 
 After we've shared a moment, after I held you tight in my arms, after I told you how beautiful you are. 
 And after I had one too many whiskies and got emotional. 
 You've just experienced the cruel honesty of the Now. 
 A look upon your careless virgin body from the upper balcony 
 And I knew this flawless silver surface had to be mine. 
 I had a huge confirmation growing in my pants pressing me to go on 
 With the said deed 
 Drive by a lust close to animal instincts, 
 (But since there's no disrespect, this is wrong and I'm sorry.), 
 I'm sorry...so sorry 
 I reacted before any kind of conscience 
 Would pollute the uniqueness of the event. 
 I can't help it, the sensation is too high, 
 The climax, is perfect... 
 After two weeks of legitimate abstinence, 
 It had to be settled somehow? 
 Yeah I heard the rumours too, 
 The ones stipulating that I've lost my reason on the account of lust... 
 I'm afraid I'll have to confirm that to the proper authorities very soon. 
 As for you love; 
 Look on the bright side child, you'll never grow old 
 So how come to me, you are still so very cold
########### Cleansed By Silence ###########
It's like hammering the face of your little brother 
 For him to stop crying... 
 Out of pure benevolence, 
 I shall proclaim myself thy older brother 
 I shall grant you the right to be taught under my tutelage, 
 For I, know better, I built Truth & Peace 
 You must reach a new level in Martyrdom, 
 As I am pouring the salty mixture of the Lord in those freshly opened veins 
 Creating wounds that won't ever heal, 
 As a reminder of your constant failure trough Existence 
 Learn from me, but dont be mystaken, 
 I expect the same treatment in return 
 Whip the Hatred out of my putrid carcass 
 I'm one of those crazy fucks, I enjoy pain... 
 (As an information, and a valid life experience) 
 This being achieved and realised, 
 Hatred is to be redirected 
 Toward you, the newly designated target, 
 Has sole victim to my sulphuric compassion 
 I'm not waging a War, I'm imposing Peace with violent means 
 I'm not loosing this War, I'm returning Peace against my Kin
########### She's Strychnine ###########
Like the Snake in Eden, only more slippery & deceitful 
 You're poison girl! 
 I could've swallowed you... 
 Seeking the proximity; to be under your flesh, 
 Flower of flesh and blood, I wanted to be your blooming 
 I felt empty the minute you walked away from me... 
 Right now; 
 I miss just everything about her, 
 The fragrance all around her neck, 
 The way she moves, fuck yeah, 
 Those tight panties... 
 I can't wait to strip you down! 
 You're a monument of aesthetic, 
 Instead of glorifying (you), I'll re-arrange your pretty smile 
 An icon to be adorned, you make me sick! 
 With a rusty cleaver, I'll be the new Da Vinci 
 Whore, Poisonous, Wine, Strychnine! 
 You please yourself in the collecting of wrecks of men 
 Who've fallen under your charms. 
 Between these luscious legs, a graveyard, 
 Has became quite a populous Nation 
 But I simply won't give in, 
 As I have seen beyond the cruelty of your looks, 
 Risen from the ashes of my love life, 
 I aim to see you suffer... 
 And I desecrate everything that has been given... 
 To you, as natural weapons, against my will 
 Weapons that you so skilfully use everyday, you call this justice? 
 To be the one, that will show you that tomorrow's morning glory is gonna be tainted 
 And simply won't happen, ever again 
 As sunrise is no more, 
 And so are you!
########### Nil  ###########
Solaris 
 Since she left I'm sleepless, 
 A year passed by since the 
 "She's Strychnine" (incident,) 
 I've swallowed it and survived... (apparently) 
 And now, due to its nature, history repeats itself....... she's gone 
 Her, the knife that brought an edge to my life 
 Remember when you use to cry out of pleasure and complete orgasm when we made love? 
 Tell me! 
 How could you take Solaris away from me? How? 
 Why the fuck did you have to go and put us through this? 
 Pound my dreams in to dust, did I truly deserve this? 
 Am I that repulsive? 
 Take away all that I had that was pure and true and give it to an insignificant piece of shit? 
 How can I possibly have faith for a better future now, you fucking life ruining bitch! 
 And still you're trying to play as if you had done nothing wrong... 
 If only I could erase everything we lived together... 
 No, instead I'm condemened to love you still. 
 ...this is useless... 
 I could go on forever... 
 ...you are useless... 
 I will go on forever
########### Lecturing Raskolnikov (Or How To Properly Stab An Old Widow) ###########
Raskolnikov: 
 "Everone spills it, the 
 blood," he answered, out of himself. 
 "Blood flows and has always flowed, as a 
 cascade. Those that make it flow like champagne 
 are crowned at the Capitol and are named the 
 benefactors of Humanity. I, once desired the good 
 of men and would've done hundreds, thousands of 
 good actions in exchange for this unique 
 stupidity, not even, this clumsiness! For the idea 
 in itself wasn't that stupid as it appears now (to 
 the light of Failure) 
 ...to the light of Failure, everything seems 
 stupid, to the light of Vengeance, everything 
 seems justified, to the light of Pity, everything 
 seems out of value. But nonetheless, I will not 
 adopt your views: if I had been successful, I 
 would've been crowned instead." 
 Dounetchka: 
 "But it's not like that, not at 
 all! Brother, what say you?" 
 Raskolnikov: 
 "Ah! The form isn't good; the 
 form is not acceptable from the standpoint view of 
 aesthetic! And well, really, I don't understand 
 how dropping bombs on the people during a siege in 
 rule replies to a more honorable form? The fear of 
 aesthetic is the first sign of powerlessness... 
 Never, never before have I so consciously seen as 
 of now, and less than ever do I understand why my 
 particular deed is a crime! A crime? Never, never 
 before have I been more convinced then as of now. 
 Never!" 
 But while pronouncing the last sentence, his look 
 met the gaze of Dounia and he read so much 
 suffering in that gaze, he succumbed. He felt 
 that, despite all, he had brought sadness to these 
 two poor women, For he was, the cause of it all...
########### You're Not Carving Deep Enough ###########
This City is lost as I am. 
 Standing still on an unfriendly sidewalk, 
 Staring at the flickering streetlights... 
 Gently pressing my palm against the dead-cold iron of the pole. 
 The lights suddenly shut and again I'm left alone with my thoughts. 
 Navigating directionless on a stream of a grey density, hiding in the confinement of a filthy back alley... 
 I think I had sex here once but that's not the point. 
 The molecules surrounding me are definitely moving at a faster pace than mine, 
 I guess that's why my vision is so blurry. 
 Dry cold air fills my lungs, leaving an aftertaste of dust in my mouth. 
 I washed it clean with several shots of vodka. 
 And why am I coughing this much? 
 I've never smoked, if I'd known maybe I would have started. 
 To quit, would've been a goal to reach in life. 
 There goes passion, out of a broken window... 
 Passing by great buildings, giants of man-made desires that are spreading their wings 
 Of darkness upon the city for miles. 
 I'm out of breath, and I can't do a thing about it... 
 (...No One will hear me scream.)
########### Shut Up, I'm Trying To Worry ###########
It's 3:57 in the morning, I know it 'cause I just passed by a payphone that told me so. 
 It caught my attention because it rang about 3 or 4 times, I'm not sure? 
 (Anyway... I didn't answer...) 
 I was way too drunk and lost into "Ulver's Perdition City" 
 To truly acknowledge what was going on. 
 And prior to that particular insignificance, I had lost all senses of time & space 
 (I'm alone and the subway docks are empty, completely deserted by the Metropolis's natives 
 Closing my eyes for a second, I could've sworn I heard tumbleweeds, rolling on the other side of the track... ) 
 Then I saw a girl, only a child to my poor tired eyes, 
 Running after what might have been fragments of my life... 
 Porcelain doll, a permanent scar on the smooth face of Depression. 
 (The phone is ringing again, breaking trough my illusions, 
 Leaving me to witness an impenetrable view upon boredom itself. 
 Could this call save me? 
 Is it salvation on the other end of the line? 
 Or just a mere attempt to disturb my concentration? 
 Still, this will have to wait.) 
 It shines; I'm sore and inspired... 
 Scribbled upon the wall, you can easily read; Amy was here, 07-12-1980 
 Answering, I simply wrote back; Hope was here... and quickly left, 02-10-2005 
 I've narrowed it down to its simplest core. 
 And I know what's required of me now... 
 There are no parallels in my mind... no subtleties. 
 And how come this phone is still ringing? 
 It'll be the last time and I'll still ignore it completely. 
 For once I think I'll be noticed, by doing something concrete & visible, 
 As of tomorrow... hundreds of humans will be late for work.
########### Signature ###########
The sound of dripping rain beating a frail window, enhancing the tick-tocking noise in my head. 
 Against the shivering glass, I cannot hear my own sobbing anymore. 
 That way, maybe I can learn to forget and forgive myself? 
 I'm not interesting, I'm interested (- Boris Vian) 
 The comforting perfume of urine mixed with mediocrity, 
 It's a matter of appreciating what you truly know. 
 It's a cynical point of view from a back alley to a crowded main street in broad daylight. 
 I could've been saved you know... a pretty girl who just passed by, smiled at me. 
 Only to realise that she was actually smiling at somebody else she knew right aside me. 
 I'm not good at being noticed. 
 There's not a chance in the world that I could possibly erase all the oily fingerprints 
 I've left on everything I've done that I'm not too proud of. 
 Yet I still think that all this crying, arguing and fighting, was good for nothing if in the end 
 I didn't kill her...
########### A Prelude Of Things Worst To Come ###########
"Heaven is where or when the Devil is losing everything at a Poker game, 
 Even Vice is laughing at him...pointing fingers. 
 And now he's walking alone in the street, completely broke & homeless 
 On the verge of collapsing to the Inevitable... 
 Even the Angels are looking down on him with pity... 
 Yet not a soul dares to help him, (the looser, the first One to have ever been cast aside.) 
 He's thinking about suicide. 
 The funny thing is, unlike us, he doesn't have a choice 
 Evil cannot die..." 
 Raindrops are weeping, and I'm a storyteller; 
 I am covered with rust & falling apart like an old 69 Chevy truck. 
 I have a lot to say if you're willing to bear with the unpleasant scent of misery & nostalgia. 
 How low can it get, when you suddenly realise that what you've been listening to, (for the last ten minutes or so) 
 Trough the old transistor radio behind the bar counter, was a disco version of Beethoven's 9th symphony. 
 I wanna kill myself right here & now. How socially dead of me (- Alias) 
 Could it be the alcohol that drank me out? 
 It feeds on your soul y'know? 
 From the other side of the looking glass, imagine a philosophy, 
 That is a sardonic aftermath of everything I lived so far...
########### The Surge ###########
The break of dawn brings forth, the tragic completion of rupture. 
 It feels as though nothing is what it seems, nightmares overwhelm my dreams. 
 Causing this, nauseating feeling inside my gut. 
 At night, cruel are these dreams which I envision throughout my mind. 
 As we lay intertwined here, enshrouded by the feeling of placidity. 
 Every aspect distinguishably as clear as could be, and I never felt more alive then when I dream of you. 
 The irony of it all leads to questioning, and thus brings on fear. 
 My thoughts clouded with uncertainty. 
 I am at battle with my inner demons. 
 I remember the contours of your lips, graciously pressed so tightly against mine. 
 Now, I'm left to wonder. 
 Uncertain these nightmares are in fact a dream. 
 While you slept I crept up to your room, careful not to make a sound. 
 I marvelled at such utter beauty, the unstableness maddening. 
 I carve through your abdomen, witnessing your eyes fade from brown to grey. 
 The surge brought me to my knees, as I permeate your chest plate, and now, feel the true meaning of having your heart ripped out, straight from your chest cavity. 
 Wither and die away already.
########### Through Evidence ###########
To proceed down this path which I call my life, is an intricate journey through dark disturbance. 
 To undertake this path again I called life, is to understand that I never once held a chance. 
 It will be the last time I will ever lay my eyes on you. 
 Oh dear Gaia. 
 My life is now slowly winding down. 
 Cold concrete has now numbed my joints, from my days locked away down here. 
 Arming myself with useless courage, I guess hoping for a miracle. 
 When in fact I'm less than a pious being, 
 (God himself couldn't save me here). 
 To undertake this path again I called life, is to understand that I never once held a chance. 
 Mother I am so scared now. 
 Unaccustomed to playing the role of the victim. 
 Uncertainty is quite dreadful, but I have pushed on too far to come back, I have pushed on too far to come back. 
 My recollection of thought is so vague, a foggy visions of repugnance. 
 Yet I do recall the look of fear, imprinted on so many nameless faces. 
 Bloodshed was inevitably welcomed from there on. 
 Held captive like a slave for days without any light. 
 Confined to a stale, ill-at-ease room. 
 How I survived so far, is a miracle in itself, now I wait ... 
 Mercy through death.
########### Kneel ###########
[Pilatus:] "Father is it possible to grant forgiveness for a sinful action to be committed?" 
 ([Father:] "My son, you would have to question whether or not the said-sin is necessary.") 
 [Pilatus:] 
 "(Absolutely...) to wash away indecency, re-write who we are. 
 Weeding out societies weakest in attempts to cure. 
 The disease which we are fed, forcefully down our throats. 
 I seek absolution for these sins unwritten. 
 Any who stand in my way, shall be subjected to torn ligaments and limbs ripped from their sockets. 
 For no pity shall be handed down to the feeble. 
 Human nature seals our fates by leading us down a path of destruction; 
 I have just merely sped up the process. 
 To wash away indecency, re-write who we are. 
 Weeding out societies weakest in attempts to cure. 
 The disease which we are fed, forcefully down our throats. 
 I seek absolution for these sins unwritten." 
 ([Father:] "Son? Why are you explaining all this to me?") 
 [Pilatus:] 
 "Well I never had much use for religion. 
 I merely needed someone to listen. 
 Father witness (the) decline of decaying culture. 
 You've, sealed your fate, sealed your doom"
########### Shunned Redeemer ###########
This life of opulence has beaten all goodness right out of us. 
 Turning men to gods, then men to despicable parasites. 
 Nurturing indecency, incapable of true motherly love. 
 We spit on preconceived notions of compassion. 
 Everything's now subjected to termination. 
 A most voracious pack guided to the point of no-return. 
 Positivism is obsolete in a world filled with greedy consumers. 
 Only deceit and prejudices leads to such aberrations. 
 This life of opulence has beaten all goodness right out of us. 
 Turning men to gods, then men to despicable parasites. 
 Advancing or regressing? 
 Should we ever consider the option? 
 How is it that our evolution became the devastating? 
 Like a child screaming, gasping to breathe, we must unlearn before treason reaches its highest possible form. 
 Disease to the Lungs, the solutions are narrowing to the same conclusions. 
 To salvage the Land, you must first rid the earth of us, the problem. 
 Like businessmen you squeeze every resource to maximize profitability. 
 Helpless followers in what seems to be a game of hid and seek, but you too will crumble beneath her wrath. 
 Tear you out, feel her wrath. 
 Year you up, feel her wrath. 
 I am thy leprous leech of a saviour. 
 Ready to take action against all indecent entrepreneurs. 
 To redeem our social values in the eyes of our Mother, and to set ablaze the masses, and their unscrupulous behaviours. 
 The mysteries of life have been erased. 
 Break this bond, the time has come, feel her wrath. 
 They mysteries of life have been replaced. 
 Break this bond, the time has come, feel her wrath.
########### Scorn Haven ###########
...And I woke up in a blur and was tied up, hurt, adrenaline scorching inside, as it raced through my veins. 
 I was coughing up blood, I must've looked like shit... and the worst part was that I had no recollection whatsoever of what, or who brought me here? 
 And why? 
 But before I could make any senses of this situation, I heard it all loudly and clearly; 
 "I resent your vile existence! 
 I truly despise what I've designed and you're a major factor in that little kid. 
 I saw an elder man, or the reflection of my future Self. 
 That's when it all came back to me; 
 The Bar, the magnum, the shots of J.D... 
 Perdition's rhetorical theory: 
 I'm sorry nobody loves you, but just think about how miserable I have become and that's all your fault. 
 I haven't smiled once since the day you were born... 
 [ref:JTHM] 
 "I give into ever day's decline, unscathed, that was just Freewill! 
 I know something's inherently wrong in this, but nonetheless, you should've treated it as a gift" said the voice. 
 "You're name is of no importance to me anymore. 
 This is how I perceive you and your kin; blood, tissues, tubes and fat. 
 A most simplistic schematic, grotesquely heightened by desires and wires. 
 Like butter scraped over too much bread, your lifeline is growing thinner, 
 [ref: LOTR] 
 Worship my pores, my sweat... palpable like my overgrowing distaste for mankind" and the voice sighed audibly. 
 As if it was scanning inward to expel the last shards of pity from its heart. 
 Or maybe it was only trying to convince itself still, but just lacking in better words to use, and now bending over the twilight blinding my swollen eyes. 
 I thought I saw God. 
 "You strayed away from the Path, now, Gott ist Tot and be the hammer my witness. 
 "I shall uproot the herd as I often did before!" said HE, the elder. 
 [ref:Nietzche] 
 During his lecture, I abruptly spring free from my shackles and with fear as weapon, strangled all life out of the elder man. 
 The poignant scenario of a dying breed and Its dilemmas. 
 The Seed overcoming its fate, and overpowering its sovereign. 
 "Fuck the Scriptures; I'm questioning the question, Through Murder; it took me five second to climb Babel's Tower"
########### Of Me... Nobody Is Safe ###########
I'll reap vengeance upon the weak. 
 My desperation mirrors your future so bleak. 
 I'll reap vengeance upon the weak. 
 I'll gratify my action so to speak. 
 The massacre of hundreds of innocent humans echoes through me, like the chorus of a symphonic orchestra. 
 Fear imprinted in their eyes so deeply, deep. 
 I'll reap vengeance upon the weak. 
 My desperation mirrors your future so bleak. 
 I'll reap vengeance upon the weak. 
 I'll gratify my actions so to speak. 
 Reap vengeance, on everyone who dared to call me a freak. 
 Pleading for mercy to be kept alive, for a brief moment longer. 
 Only to shatter a glimpse of hope held so dear, of one day seeing sunlight again. 
 My dementia praecox has pushed me over the edge to unstableness. 
 Failure to react has led us here. 
 Pushing this illness to new extremes. 
 Feel this, my desperation. 
 Hear my plea, my desperation. 
 Feel this, my desperation. 
 Conceive my desire to inflict retribution. 
 A distant memory of roaming these streets daily overshadows me. 
 The mind numbing sensation that I could have accomplished so much more. 
 Is it any wonder why we're are all here today? 
 I am the mastermind behind your demise, a victim of abuse now willing to die for his gratification. 
 I'll reap vengeance upon the weak. 
 My desperation mirrors your future so bleak. 
 I'll reap vengeance upon the weak. 
 I'll gratify my actions so to speak. 
 Who knew I was capable of such barbarism?
########### Void Of Conscience ###########
He said "can't you understand that I don't have time for this today". 
 What goes in one ear goes out the other. 
 Everything he said rendered useless. 
 He yelled "Hey! What do you think you're doing man?" 
 To be quite honest, I couldn't care less what this creep thinks. 
 Hormone's powerfully controlling my every move. 
 What goes in one ear goes out the other. 
 Everything he said rendered useless. 
 "I have acquired a hatred for mankind" I said. 
 "Your putrid life is as meaningless as a cockroach to me". 
 He kicked fiercely to break free from my stronghold, despair now clouds his dread filled eyes. 
 He screamed "help me!". 
 No one will hear your cry for help locked away down here. 
 Releasing all built up tension. 
 Begging for pity, forcing culmination. 
 Choking the life out of him. 
 What goes in one ear goes out the other. 
 Everything he said, rendered useless. 
 I fight to keep a grip on sanity. 
 Beating his face to a pulp on the sidewalk. 
 His bruised body now reflects my bruised ego. 
 Perfection, the look in his eye as, I stole his life. 
 Naive was he to trust a stranger.
########### Tarnished Trepidation ###########
With a dissatisfying taste in my mouth, I swallow what's left of my pride, as I am fed my last meal. 
 Remember how I claimed to be less than a pious being? 
 You can now leave me father, no words could excuse me now. 
 Now words could excuse me now. 
 Each Iron bar holds a secret meaning, given during my time here. 
 Each Iron bar holds a different face, tarnished before my time here. 
 The once feared "man dressed in black", now a symbol of anticipation. 
 My only regret, not being able to ride my soul of these minacious voices. 
 With time they have grown, colder pushing my ego to an intense solstice. 
 When they come for me, I will not fight. 
 I am ready to go in peace, the time is right. 
 I was foolish to believe, that I could single-handedly save humanity. 
 The sacrifice was offered long before I was conceived. 
 But beware, where I failed. Someone will inevitably succeed. 
 Someone will succeed. 
 My legs and arms are now braced tightly. 
 I feel my pulse through theses shackles. 
 Frail and frigid I lay, hopelessly on the confines of the silver table known to me as my death bed. 
 Slowly losing control, growing number. 
 My eyes close. 
 I bid myself farewell. 
 As to those whose lives were lost on the account of these homicides, the sacrifice was offered long before I was conceived. 
 I was conceived
########### You People Are Messed Up ###########
Why complicate the reasons behind preceding failures lying within us? 
 Look beyond deceit, journey through the corridors of convoluted mazes of departure. 
 Knowing damn well that our previous encounters were merely known as stepping stones. 
 Onward to our intended destiny. 
 Abolish all, all preconceived, notions of our former self's. 
 [Chorus:] 
 This time around 
 We are back with a vengeance 
 Groomed with agility, 
 Our styles packed with versatility. 
 So brace yourselves for this devastation 
 A punch to the face 
 Prepared and inclined to detonate this world 
 Go fuck yourselves 
 [Chorus] 
 No holds barred. 
 Mediocrity considered as fair play. 
 Our strongest beliefs. 
 Your narrowed point of views 
 You don't deserve to be alive 
 Senseless morons will never take our self respect.
########### The More Things Change, The More They Stay The Same ###########
If you are a blameless victim, I guess that makes me the culprit in this absurd affair. Never would have I imagined it to be quite like this. Recap and play it back. No matter how you look at this, the numbers they never lie. Unable to wrap my head around this, the only question left is why? To salvage what's left of these fading memories. Furious bursts of rage overwhelm the best of us. A scapegoat for all your fucking flaws. The breaking point becomes inevitable. My soul is protected by fire, reinforced with optimism. Conforming to what was begged of us. Through thick and thin, we stood our ground. We fought tough and held our own, we stood our ground. If you are the innocent victim, I guess that makes me the culprit in this affair. To salvage what's left of these fading memories. Furious bursts of rage overwhelm the best of us. A scapegoat for all your fucking flaws.
########### This Is The Last Time I Repeat Myself ###########
I'm never going to live this one down. The weight of these burdens held upon our fail backs, just what where you thinking? A feeble minded idea you got caught up in. Stained with a poignant shade of shame, tears fill the void in your bland eyes. You find yourself trembling over words you cannot bear to speak. What the fuck is the matter with you? After all the shit that you put us through, is this really what we've come to? When broken down, this feels just like déjà vue. You know that it's inevitable, that all things good must eventually come to an end. A bond kept strong for 12 years long, now here we stand writing up this song. Believe me you will know this deception. This anguish felt from the treacherous betrayal you've drawn upon us through the years. Through it all, I can't help but feel fatuous. Reminiscing over everything, this seems all too predictable. Were we ever worth our former selves, tonight still plenty young and we're yet to become. The very thought of confronting you with these allegations, recollections of past life obsess my every sentiment. We won't go down without a fight. What the fuck is the matter with you? After all the shit that you put us through, is this really what we've come to? When broken down, this feels like just déjà vue.
########### No Care Ever ###########
Could more have been done? Bright lights flashing through the night sky. Incoherent voices flood the void consumed. Gazing over the remains of this transformed cast, how could we left it come to this? Finding yourself stranded at crossroads. Hesitant to proceed forward. Led to believe from the start that we are the ones to break the mold and our insecurities are obstacles to overcome. Choking on bullshit lies, introduced by our forefathers. The notion of absolution. This notion of absolution, the profoundest of fairy tales declared. From the depths we have risen overcoming these said obstacles. Feel our inspiration arise, strengthen these ties, masking the truth before our very eyes. I stand before you today battered and bruised, rusted broken and abused. I no longer want to play my part in this. I now refuse to play a role in this. The harshest of realizations is understanding that through this. Throughout this mess, I could have done more. Finding yourself stranded at crossroads. Reluctant to proceed forward. Led to believe from the start that we are the ones to break the mold.
########### After Everything That's Happened, What Did You Expect ###########
Fuck you... so after everything that's happened here between us, just what the fuck did you expect? I put up with all your bullshit and games, not to mention disrespect. Now after everything that's gone down here between us, can you finally come forth and admit your faults? Fuck! Who the hell am I kidding? I know that you haven't changed at all. Over consumed with popularity and looks, unable to free myself from these ridiculous hooks. It was never in my nature to act out in rage, unleashing a bitter being of uncanny viciousness. It's time to take out the trash. Bitch, I'm taking you out tonight. When I'm through with you, no one will ever want anything to do with you again. Go fuck yourself you're an ignorant hood rat.
########### We Like To Call This One... Fuck Off ###########
Can you taste the sarcasm off my breath? Can you hear our frustration streaming through your ears? I've spent my whole life waiting for this moment, not to worry though; tonight's feeling like this might be the one. For I am the spark to light this flame, I'm the wind blowing your houses down. I'm the fear atrociously consumed, nightmares you cannot rid yourself of, until the end of days in pursuit of this. For I am the spark to light this flame, I'm the wind blowing your houses down. Can you see consequences to your actions? Can you smell our vindication in the air? What's that look you carry on your face signify? Not to worry though; tonight's feeling like this might be the one. I'm the fear atrociously consumed, nightmares you cannot rid yourself of. The sole purpose of my my existence. The sole purpose of my very existence, defined by the extremeness of which you felt so strong. Ramification shall be paid. I've been reconfigured, precisely crafted, molded to perfection, in order to make every single moment of the remainder of your insignificant life a settlement of sorts, for the end always justifies the means.
########### Can Someone Please Explain This To Me? ###########
Can someone please explain this to me? All signs indicate the worst still to come. Who will be there to break our fall? Better yet, who'll stick around to tear down this wall? Ostracized from our domestic habitation. Heavily blinded from characterization. All the while helping to strengthen and solidify our local foundations, establishing our safe haven. I wouldn't change a single thing about it. A common goal for us all to strive for. So why's it all swerving out of control? Out of focus. It's slowly fading away in the distance. Every attempt made at survival has failed. Panic stricken the fear eats you alive. Stranded in solitude, with only the blackness of night guiding these damned souls. Remain with the idea of redemption through renewal. To be reborn into this youthful wake of rejuvenation. To attack the whole with new tactics and groove. Our motivation secured for years to come.
########### Disaster In Sight ###########
A foul stench of fear overwhelms us all. Willingly marching this path unknown. We're left with the dull realization; we once sat high up on this broken throne. They came and left without a trace. Undeniable, yet so quick and prompt, like a ghost baring no face. A wretched disease injected within us, poisoning our souls and darkening our creation. Beneath these crowded streets lies the savage from our pasts, reborn into questionable beings of menacing expression. Coming forth to bestow our transition into this. Burn this city down. Too many sleepless hours wasted dwelling over what could have been. Knowing that someday we might just win. Determined to persist on forward, brother or none I'm here as a reminder. The time is now. Come alive, secure our demise in this. Wipe the slate clean from the lies of our distinct resurgence.
########### This Is Considered Mere Formality ###########
Every now and then life forces you to choose sides, straying from the course of your everyday passage. Our intuition blindly leading us into uncharted grounds, a blackened shrine captivating fearless intellects. Nothing can affect our alliance here. Forcing a deaf ear to all their critiques. Rekindling embers of a departed past seems so much easier said than done. These bodies are far from being indestructible. Contradicting what we were brought up to believe. While your lives hang in the balance, we stand indecisive as to which way to venture. We're born infidel to our upbringings and our every fraternal instinct. Sit back and watch these lives collapse, knowing that compassion can be carried out. To change individuals for the better with a simple wish to make these wrongs, right.
########### This Feels Like The End... ###########
I'd like to trust that you're not a piece of shit as you fooled us all into believing. Some how, deep down I know we're all mistaken, you remain a moronic passing phase. It's ironic to see yourself as the villain and mutual trust was never considered as a given right. The day my fist comes into contact with your face, I hope you'll realize that your life's a disgrace, you punk ass chump. Keep running your mouth like you're some kind of know it all, you know what they say? The taller they are the harder they fall. There's nothing left to say about this fib of treachery and so we fall back down just to pick ourselves back up again. This is my town, this is my hood, don't get shit misunderstood, you wouldn't get it even if you could. Still spotting you at all the places we used to meet, keep sporting that obnoxious smile on your face. Your mother. Your poor mother raised a pathetic asshole. She's best to kiss you goodnight one last time before I never give her the chance again. Don't get it twisted, my goal's not to take you out. It's to disgrace your name in shame and all which you stand for. I don't know why you think you're slick, I don't know why you think you're quick, I know you can't compete with this dick, all I know is you're gonna wish you'd quit. The day my fist comes into contact with your face, I hope you realize that your life's a disgrace, you punk ass chump. I don't know why you think you're sick, I don't know why you brought your clique, I know you can't compete with this dick, all I know is you're gonna wish you'd quit. Your life ain't shit. You don't got what it takes to roll with us. Pull over and hand me my nine, I know I got you as soon as I spot you.
########### They'll Never Know ###########
I seek through these charred remnants for a vulnerable person I once knew. We outgrew all our shattered dreams. Our hopes for the future were as bold as any. Now look at where we ended up. The day my fist comes into contact with your fucking face, I hope you'll realize your life's a disgrace. You white trash bitch. Keep running your mouth like you're some kind of know it all. You know you're gonna fall. Your life ain't shit.

########### Exit ###########
Now it's time to breathe 
 Your first breath 
 Welcome to the real world 
 No longer are you held down 
 By these imaginary boundaries 
 The time is now 
 Can you hear me? 
 Can you hear me 
 Looking down at the earth? 
 Is when you call yourself King 
 That's when you call yourself King
########### Delirium ###########
See? I told you 
 You can't love a monster 
 You can't even look me 
 Straight in my eyes 
 Why are you afraid? 
 Does the simple thought of my 
 Being alive make you pray for the exit? 
 I am a monster 
 I'm not sick 
 I am the disease 
 I have 
 Fallen in love 
 With the 
 Feeling of 
 Being filled with all this toxic 
 Being filled with all this toxic 
 I am numb 
 My vision spiraled into cycles of darkness 
 What I've become 
 Is something more than I thought I could be 
 In order to find the truth 
 You must make the questions 
 To become more than a follower 
 You must make the answers 
 The answers
########### Vain Words From Empty Minds ###########
Waking up on the other side of the sunrise 
 My diolation will stay the same 
 I've grown accustomed to these cold winds 
 Sending shivers down my back 
 This is how I live 
 This is how I will die 
 You can tell me I'm sick 
 I still think you're full of shit 
 My serenity is in the empty half 
 Of the hourglass 
 And when the time runs out 
 I will turn the tables 
 We are no different than the ones you stand by 
 On the outside 
 The differences between you and I 
 Lie inside 
 A life 
 Consisting of a constant high 
 At least I'll always know 
 That I'm alive 
 At least I know I'm alive 
 When will you realize that you take all this too seriously 
 Live life by the owl's call 
 Fuck the ones that try to tell you how the system breathes 
 Live life by the owl's call 
 My serenity is in the empty half 
 Of the hourglass 
 And when the time runs out 
 I will turn the tables 
 It's so sad to me 
 The worst part of you 
 Took away the best part of me, away the best part of me 
 I used to tell myself 
 That I would never become someone else, 
 But I thought I told myself 
 I was going to be somebody 
 It's not coincidence 
 Things played out this way 
 I know you had this planned from the start 
 Luckily for me 
 I can see right through you now
########### Bridges ###########
Tell me again how my life should be 
 My eyes don't see the way you see 
 Why does my mind play all of these tricks on me 
 Yes, I know now 
 My decisions 
 Have led me down this path with no escape 
 Your nightmares 
 Are only my dreams 
 This is home now, at least that's how it seems 
 Have you ever walked with one who wanders 
 This is forever 
 For so long, I've been searching for 
 The other half of my heart 
 But now I see, the other side of me 
 Isn't quite who I thought I was 
 I am so lost 
 Inside of my own head 
 Tell me 
 Who do you think that you are 
 Walking over others' bridges 
 Like you built them yourself 
 You 
 Ruined me 
 You 
 Took it 
 All away 
 Now stay gone
########### Lost Pages ###########
This, this is your moment 
 So take your first step through the door 
 This is what happens when you ignore 
 The ones who say dreams aren't worth fighting for 
 Every mistake 
 Every single moment of regret 
 It can all be left behind 
 If you have the strength to let go 
 If you have the strength 
 To let go 
 I know that the hours seem like days 
 With my heads in my hands I beg 
 For my peace, 
 My peace of mind 
 I see as 
 The days pass 
 And I see 
 You forgetting 
 My face and 
 It hurts so much 
 I cannot explain 
 How much I wish 
 This would go away 
 Do you see 
 The way that things could be 
 Or do you only notice 
 The way that they are 
 I was lost 
 In a place with no light 
 And somewhere down this path 
 You turned away, away, away 
 I'm wondering where you've gone 
 I'm wondering 
 I'm wondering 
 I'm wondering 
 Where you've gone 
 I'm wondering 
 I'm wondering 
 I'm wondering 
 Where you've gone 
 This will not be 
 The last time you see me 
 I promise 
 This will not be 
 The last time you see me 
 I promise
########### Candle ###########
I am not afraid to let the world know 
 You ripped my soul from my fucking chest 
 I have opened my eyes 
 Only to see you are my enemy 
 The candle is burning out 
 Is there any escape? 
 And if there is, can you show me the way? 
 I don't want to play this game 
 I just want to disappear 
 And if you take my hand 
 Well I can show you who I really am 
 Wave away to all the pain 
 Were bringing all the light back 
 This candle is burning out 
 You put the blame on me 
 To take the weight off your burden 
 Someday you will see 
 You can't escape fate 
 Is there any escape? 
 And if there is, can you show me the way? 
 I don't want to play this game 
 I just want to disappear 
 And if you take my hand 
 Well I can show you who I really am 
 Wave away to all the pain 
 Were bringing all the light back 
 The reason 
 You are alone 
 Is because you left us all behind 
 I know 
 That you know why 
 We turned our backs for the last time
########### This House ###########
This house is an empty home 
 The thought process of an abandoned child 
 Left alone to sort out all the answers 
 To questions he has never heard 
 And when he falls asleep 
 He cannot dream 
 It is only a fantasy of a brighter place 
 Only a figment of a taunting imagination 
 ([?] forever) 
 How do I seem to fall to the floor 
 Hopeless and broken 
 Every time that I convince my mind 
 The other side is sunshine 
 I'm so sick of letting myself 
 (Letting myself, letting myself) 
 Be a victim to your bars and chains 
 I let myself walk away from who I was 
 Just to see if you could love me 
 And all I found 
 Was this empty path 
 Left alone 
 To walk on my own 
 A nightmare 
 Is only inspiration
########### Exist ###########
I can see it in your eyes 
 You're becoming invisible 
 Do you even exist? 
 Do you even exist anymore? 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 You're becoming invisible 
 Do you even exist? 
 Do you even exist anymore? 
 Do you even exist anymore?

########### Molotov Brother ###########
Look closely at this heart 
 And you'll see what you forgot 
 What ever happened to "just be what you want 
 Be what you want?" 
 Eat it up and breathe it in 
 Let it become you like it's always been 
 What ever happened to "just be what you want 
 Be what you want?" 
 (What you want) 
 Lies! 
 Your empire 
 Simple denial 
 Run aground 
 Tell me what have you got to lose? 
 Never too late to start again 
 For it is only just a means to an end 
 What ever happened to "just be what you want 
 Be what you want?" 
 Lies! 
 Your empire 
 Simple denial 
 Run aground 
 Tell me what have you got to lose? 
 (Nothing 
 Nothing left to lose) 
 Nothing left! 
 I am a molotov brother, you will only get burned 
 With all the hate, make no mistake 
 The flames will only get worse 
 For those who call me unforgivable 
 I'm raising the fire 
 And I'm to far gone to know I've gone too far 
 Rid this world of our solemn regrets 
 No, this war isn't lost, I'll declare it again 
 The day when you fall, when you flip and lose your mind 
 It's only a matter of time
########### Beneath The Smiles ###########
The scars 
 Beneath their smiles 
 Run length to length 
 A million miles 
 The wisdom 
 Of a broken child 
 Who feels at home 
 Amidst the fire 
 Master knows 
 And he knows best 
 The universe 
 Within his chest 
 The ascendant rise 
 The cowards fall 
 Learn nothing 
 When you know it all 
 Are we men 
 Or are we mice? 
 For certain death 
 Awaits outside 
 We must beat 
 This system now 
 There's too many 
 To take them down 
 The only way 
 We'll make it out 
 Is to shed ourselves 
 Of shame and doubt 
 The only way 
 We'll make it out 
 Is if we make or break 
 Without a sound 
 Seize their prize 
 Storm the gates 
 For all we know 
 They sleep awake 
 They're marching 
 To the drums like sheep 
 Take a bow 
 And grit your teeth 
 The shrouded moon 
 It's a sign 
 We have to move now 
 It is time 
 Are we men 
 Or are we mice? 
 For certain death 
 Awaits outside 
 We must beat 
 This system now 
 There's too many 
 To take them down 
 The only way 
 We'll make it out 
 Is to shed ourselves 
 Of shame and doubt 
 The only way 
 We'll make it out 
 Is if we make or break 
 Without a sound 
 Seize their prize 
 Storm the gates 
 For all we know 
 They sleep awake 
 We will overcome 
 Atonement awaits 
 Unseen to the eyes

I assure you I am real 
 You're thinking 
 How could that be? 
 And could a man 
 Be so serene? 
 Such a vision of power? 
 Well, my dear 
 It's plain to see 
 I am a man 
 With everything 
 As the flowers 
 Bow to me 
 And they behold their lord 
 Whatever you want 
 Consider it done, baby 
 Everything, your deepest desires

 I would become 
 The greatest king 
 Bring the people 
 To their knees 
 Shower them with love 
 The mystics have forseen 
 I realize the prophecy 
 Deliver this world 
 From the enemy 
 Unify a soul as one 
 Whatever you want 
 Consider it done, baby 
 Everything, your deepest desires 
 For I am the man 
 Whatever you want 
 Consider it done 
 I'll be there 
 Tell me all your deepest desires 
 For I am the man 
 To me, it's all a game 
 Committed in my name 
 My currency of pain 
 I'll cast the world into the flames 
 It's not easy to be me 
 Got a lot of responsibilities 
 And such popularity 
 I feel like I could cry 
 I give it all and they can see 
 I am a brilliant entity 
 Emitting glorious energy 
 By the grace of gods, go I 
 Whatever you want 
 Consider it done, baby 
 Everything, your deepest desires 
 For I am the man 
 Whatever you want 
 Consider it done 
 I'll be there 
 Tell me all your deepest desires

 You know I love to, love to 
 Love to be me, baby 
 I think you'd love to love me 
 You know, baby, yeah 
 Whatever you want 
 Consider it done, baby 
 Everything, your deepest desires 
 For I am the man 
 Whatever you want 
 Consider it done 
 I'll be there 
 Tell me all your deepest desires 
 For I am the man 
 Whatever you want 
 Consider it done, baby

Every breath, every step 
 How remote their control 
 I will run 
 I will be 
 I will break stranglehold 
 Once we'll be overwhelmed 
 Once we reach our greater selves 
 All we know will be complete 
 We will overcome gravity 
 I must break free 
 Through this wall 
 Must wake up from this dream 
 I can hear them calling me 
 I will endure, I will be here 
 We only see what we want to see

 When we've given everything we feel

 We're moving to the end of lightning speed

 What we don't understand is the enemy 
 All of time, all that's won 
 A tiny seed, an atom ball 
 We retreat and we hide 
 We'll be back before too long 
 Centrifuge the empire 
 We'll subside, be retired 
 Then we'll live without regret 
 We will overcome our greatest fears

 Must wake up from this dream

 You're anchored by gravity

 Yet through it all 
 We shall remain 
 Behold the hands behind the throne 
 Their frequency unknown 
 The hands behind the throne 
 The calm before the storm
########### Manufacture Of Consent ###########
It has begun 
 And we will amplify the energy 
 You are the first 
 And it is time to merge duality 
 An overlapping wave of ever-blazing synergy 
 Has arrived to realign you with infinity 
 You may deny you're a soul 
 But that is everything 
 For the sake of this whole world 
 A sacred entity 
 An overlapping wave of ever-blazing synergy 
 Has arrived to realign you with humanity 
 So, wake up! 
 Beneath the haze 
 Our leaders 
 They manufacture consent 
 For control of the kingdom 
 And in their wake 
 The people break 
 They're vanquished 
 Enslaved in a triumph of ego 
 We won't accept the hand we're dealt 
 Here we go 
 This is war 
 All we know 
 No control 
 You will fall 
 Your needless war 
 This sleight-of-hand 
 We'll never be the same
########### Coming For You ###########
Be ready, 
 I'm coming for you! 
 Be ready, 
 I'm coming for you! 
 Be ready, 
 I am coming! 
 We are always within, 
 Instead of without, 
 So much so, 
 We had forgotten 
 All about you, 
 If we were to be sure, 
 We had to savour the doubt, 
 But now you know, 
 There is a plan in place, 
 We shall pierce 
 Through the veil, 
 And absolve you. 
 You buried their heart, 
 Buried their soul, 
 You buried your guilt, 
 And you refused to atone, 
 You buried their father, 
 Buried the truth, 
 Well you best be ready, 
 As I'm coming for you! 
 Make peace within, 
 Emanate it without, 
 So much so, 
 They could never force 
 Their coercion upon you, 
 If you're ever unsure, 
 Beyond reasonable doubt, 
 Hope you know, 
 We will be here to 
 Embrace you, 
 As we emancipate you. 
 We will see 
 Without our eyes, 
 As all will unite 
 And rise tonight. 
 We will unify!

You are the owner/operator, 
 You are the designated driver, 
 The captain and the crew,

 This is your world, 
 And you, 
 It's master 
 Brother, 
 This is your dominion, 
 When will you embrace, 
 And love your kingdom, 
 Your kingdom! 
 You are the self-made liberator, 
 You are the heart-wave generator, 
 From death into the new, 
 The I, I see in you, 
 You are the light accelerator. 
 Brother, 
 This is your dominion, 
 When will you embrace, 
 And love your kingdom, 
 Your kingdom! 
 I am the self-made liberator, 
 I am the alpha and omega. 
 Brother, 
 This is your dominion, 
 When will you embrace, 
 And love your kingdom,

########### Mother Sky ###########
I sit still and silent 
 For a moment 
 In the light of the act 
 If I clear my mind 
 I am rising beyond all space and time 
 There's nothing that I have to do 
 To be who I am, yeah 
 Now I release to the mother sky 
 All I have to transmute this illusion 
 I lost my grip but I have you now 
 How can this be? I have become my enemy 
 I lost my grip but I have you now 
 How can this be? I've become my enemy 
 I repair the shattered diamond 
 To it's wholeness 
 With these bloodstained hands 
 Just as I designed 
 I am rising beyond all space and time 
 Nothing that I have to do to be who I am 
 Now I release to the mother sky 
 All I have to transmute this illusion 
 I lost my grip but I have you now 
 How can this be? I have become my enemy 
 I lost my grip but I have you now 
 How can this be? what become my enemy 
 Will you see the black of the eye 
 Separated from the white 
 If the enemy has shrouded the eye 
 One must prepare to die 
 Now I release to the mother sky 
 All I have to transmute this illusion 
 I lost my grip but I have you now 
 How can this be? I have become my enemy 
 I lost my grip but I have you now 
 How can this be? I've become my enemy

The last breath, 
 Of a dying regime, 
 From upon its own sword, 
 It will return to the dream, 
 In the days ahead, 
 We will re-build and release, 
 Return unto the light, 
 'Til we're cleansed, 
 And complete. 
 As for this cursed machine, 
 We'll make a break, 
 For the nation, 
 Of the next dark king, 
 'Til we have secured his inevitable defeat, 
 This is the way, 
 To your destiny. 
 Our time has come, 
 To dismantle the dark, 
 We march on, 
 Once and for all. 
 At daybreak, 
 With absolute godspeed, 
 Into the confrontation, 
 With renewed majesty, 
 In the days ahead, 
 We will embrace all we fear, 
 Return unto the light, 
 'Til we're whole and complete. 
 As for this cursed machine, 
 We'll take the mantle 
 Of the fallen, 
 With a force, 
 Legendary.

 Once and for all. 
 Here comes the flood 
 Into the flame,

########### Deluge ###########
You rode the vibration of anger like riding the tide out to sea 
 You tried to find the face of salvation, but all you found was me 
 Now you're staring at the sword in your chest like I owe you an apology 
 I would never suspect that you would do this to your family, but no mercy 
 You're not alone 
 I will arise and arrive from the depth of this hole 
 You must atone 
 When I reconcile with the force at the depth of my soul I will be home 
 You've got nowhere left to go 
 I've fought through liars and lows, and it all ends now 
 I'm hitting you where it hurts, and this is all you deserve 
 And it all ends now 
 Oh how the tables have turned 
 Oh how your temples will burn 
 You've got nowhere left to go, you'd best prepare for the storm 
 And it all ends, and it all ends now 
 You condemn me as the devil himself in an attempt to erase my spark 
 But since the devil don't exist where I am, he could only be where you are 
 You're not alone 
 I will arise and arrive from the depth of this hole 
 You must atone 
 When I reconcile with the force at the depth of my soul I will be home 
 You've got nowhere left to go 
 I've fought through liars and lows, and it all ends now 
 I'm hitting you where it hurts, and this is all you deserve 
 And it all ends now 
 Oh how the tables have turned 
 Oh how your temples will burn 
 You've got nowhere left to go, you'd best prepare for the storm 
 And it all ends, and it all ends now 
 I have walked in to the dark so I could come to know the light 
 The light!
########### Liberation ###########
Awakening 
 To all we were and all that we've become 
 Apathy 
 Your vain in desperation 
 Hail to the thief 
 The cavalcade of victims interfaced 
 To revere the hate, the orchestration 
 Say oh can you see the manipulation 
 I have a dream of liberation 
 Guarantees now worth the print of paper bloodstained currency 
 We rape our world of patience 
 Awakening 
 When we begin to face all we've allowed to be 
 In our name 
 A transmutation 
 Say oh can you see the manipulation 
 I have a dream of liberation 
 Say oh can you see the manipulation 
 I have a dream of liberation

 New dawn 
 Isn't it beautiful? 
 As you are beautiful 
 Remove, your veil 
 You hold onto the wisdom, you that woke the wave of contact. 
 A blink, of an eye, 
 take a breath as if it's going to be your final moment 
 It's time you claimed it for your own 
 Even if it means going alone 
 The path less travelled will eventually lead you

 Subject to summoning a landslide 
 You have adultered the alter 
 Of a faceless serpentine call of a riddle

 They are pulling every last stop 
 You will not falter 
 You offer to the people consistently caught in the middle 
 I'll send for you when the coast is clear

 The inconspicuous now made known

 Now you must confront your demons alone 
 It unfolds in defence in damage control 
 In denial of transgression you become target of vindication

 Like great oaks rising from acorns 
 Truth in the light becomes the perfect storm 
 Settled score, justice swift and the rift is closed 
 You're delivered a final blow 
 Now you are down on your knees, you're dethroned 
 We got your picture, caught your act by the throat

########### Rational Eyes ###########
Pure resistance, unborn to the fraudulent world 
 Face revision, the spawn of hate. 
 Forgiveness is distant now 
 Rising against the origin, 
 I am only one 
 Scanning the surface with rational eyes, 
 Driving deeper we'll reach our demise. 
 This cannot go on 
 I can see this world is all alone 
 I won't be a victim 
 I can feel the end of all i've known 
 I won't be a victim 
 Our world will fall 
 In the end man will rise and kill all 
 This can't go on 
 I am understanding why, 
 all these miles away 
 I'm not the enemy
########### As I Destruct ###########
I embrace this pitiful race, 
 reaching out to a world of disgrace 
 I'm willing to sacrifice, 
 implosion of emotion never reaching prime 
 Burning inside the mind, 
 all these thoughts must unwind 
 Stirring close to the edge, 
 never reaching the end 
 I'm falling down, 
 forever in spite over you 
 Save me as i fall, 
 as i destruct 
 It's not to late, 
 to design and reveal a notion 
 It's not to late, 
 to indulge and find a solution 
 My silence, 
 won't heal the damage inside me 
 Fallen from grace, 
 I refuse to die with the answers 
 Time to go, 
 into the void, to the unknown 
 Time to go, 
 today will mark evolution 
 When all is lost, 
 i'll never end 
 Striving to live again
########### One Last Breath ###########
Burn the bridges of the empire, 
 the kingdom will fall 
 Infaction of democracy, 
 bleed the weak and sew the eyes, of them all 
 My solace will not bring us down, 
 generations fall to the ground 
 The absence, the sorrow, ensue 
 mind fucking the truth 
 Feel so far away, 
 it's burning on the inside 
 I am so cold, 
 one last breath 
 Count the victims as they die, 
 embed the thoughts in your mind 
 Regression of peace for all life, 
 man, the power, the drive, will decide 
 The violence will drag us down, 
 as blood spills we fall to the ground 
 This world is not a slave, 
 we must embrace 
 It's time to rise 
 Everyday more people die 
 from mindless acts of violence 
 Man will kill us all, he will kill us all
########### Seeing Red ###########
Blind the eyes of humanity, 
 twisting the minds of this race 
 Living disgrace, 
 abomination driving everyone towards the hate 
 I am justified to unite with my own kind, 
 not to follow, not to prejudge 
 I decide who's real from what's revealed, 
 this shattered past can't conceal 
 For all the tears i've shed, 
 this one for you is red 
 It's so unreal 
 What will it take, 
 to repent your mistakes? 
 This war will be won, 
 we've only just begun 
 The blood has been shed and the rows 
 upon rows of the dead are unknown, 
 the victims who lie deep beneath us 
 at peace are not forgotten 
 For all the tears, 
 the tears i've shed 
 I'm bleeding and so should you
########### A New Beginning ###########
Face down on the way to the end, 
 I'm fighting to breathe, dont bury me 
 Consume our lives, control our minds 
 I've taken the strength that was left behind 
 I'm pulling deeper from within 
 (deeper from within), 
 the answers bleeding through my skin 
 Serenity dies 
 If i could breathe again 
 (if i could breathe again), 
 I'd choose a new beginning 
 (a new beginning) 
 Salvation will save us all, 
 the lacerations will heal 
 Rise beyond the threshold, 
 surpass all obsruction 
 We will survive 
 I'm falling away from this artificial life 
 Omit treason cast upon thee, 
 my revelations, beginning a new life
########### Counterbalance ###########
I have embraced your innocence, 
 I've been cut through the flesh 
 and i can resist, building life again 
 Drawn back to the edge, 
 to the essence of my fear 
 With every ounce of strength, 
 I intend to survive this life 
 And we are shaped into a mold that we can't choose 
 Deception will bury us all, animosity 
 For the actions that kill all respect and desire 
 And we are hopeless now, 
 bring back the day 
 And we are hopeless now 
 I'm lost again 
 dead inside 
 Drowning without you now 
 lost again 
 Drowning without your love 
 dead inside 
 Dead inside your eyes 
 lost again 
 Dying without you
########### Inane ###########
Impaled by the thorn, mechanical, 
 inane it's your sacrifice 
 Rational thought evaded by false concept, 
 collapse and paralyze 
 I am turning the inside out, 
 for the rest of duration 
 Penetrate to feel on the inside, 
 grip of lust or love i can't decide 
 Tears thicken self-control override, 
 repressed, release is dignified 
 Fallen down to my knees, 
 bleeding violently over me 
 Silenced by words of hate, 
 laying motionless, walking toward the light
########### Now ###########
The face of the deceitful ones, 
 lies in the veins held inside 
 Slowly bleeding, impeding our lives, 
 until war has begun 
 Now it's time to display our aggression, 
 now it's time to explode 
 Now we build up a wall of retention, 
 now we hold our own 
 Seething all these words unsaid, 
 it's time to believe what's right 
 Open your eyes 
 They are the ones, the degradation 
 cheat, decieve and lie 
 Contrive the end of us all, 
 retribution is now, vengeance is now 
 They are the one's, 
 the degradation 
 Your time is now
########### Faceless ###########
Dawn the face of a new generation, 
 the revision of life is here 
 Born into segregation, 
 second guess the existence of you 
 Falling into the hell below, 
 not understanding the reason why 
 Punish the weak, 
 to release all the hate inside 
 Thine eyes are so bleak, 
 your intentions seem to drive us in the ground 
 There's nothing left to breathe for, 
 this life was dead before it began 
 Now it's time to accept the end 
 Taken the life, 
 from the one that created you 
 Holding the knife, 
 unleash the rage that's been haunting you 
 Nothing seems to change, 
 your life has slipped away, fallen within 
 Silenced bound enslaved, 
 your locked away, rotting within 
 As time slips away, 
 the cage will rust 
 And life will go on, 
 as you fall to dust
########### Haunting ###########
Aggression is burning, 
 it fuels my own obsessions 
 The blood drains out, 
 inspires my inspiration 
 I can't breathe, 
 I'm trapped in concrete 
 Close my eyes, 
 kill me in my sleep 
 I'm just a number to them 
 Erratic pulses surge, 
 my mind in tension 
 Bleeding incisions, 
 restrained into submission 
 The righteous are forced into exile, 
 I'm not alone 
 Reaching the end in this cage, 
 I can't hold on 
 All that was me, 
 I've come to be 
 Where I belong, 
 I am prepared to die
########### When All Is Said And Done ###########
Break the chains and release me from this struggle, 
 I have the right to see freedom 
 Not like the rest, 
 so weak and powerless 
 I rise to face the day 
 Burn down my whole inspiration, 
 burn me into the ground 
 I will never surrender or silence 
 Bind to false ideals and never let them go, 
 fake words for the feeble minded 
 My path is strong, 
 we need to find redemption 
 Remove your face from the dirt 
 Burn down my whole inspiration, 
 burn me into the ground 
 I will never surrender or silence 
 When all is said and done, 
 we are to blame 
 I search to find the answer, 
 but nothing seems to fit, I am disposed 
 With this shadow walking beside me, 
 I'm not alone 
 With all this weight on my shoulders, 
 dragging me down, 
 I'm not alone 
 Trusting life in the hands, 
 of the ravenous ones 
 breathing lies until the end, 
 till the end of man 
 Raping the world from the inside, 
 killing us all 
 I vow to serve and protect myself from this mess 
 I vow with utmost intent, no lies 
 Drown the population with the revolting 
 gallons they have bled, 
 reap and pillage, find the truth and see how we've been misled 
 And this world we call our home, 
 will in turn decay 
 till the end of days 
 And we're blinded by the sun, 
 that consumes the day 
 till the end of me
########### Afterlife ###########
I remember the look on your face 
 And all the memories of you 
 A loving girl with no fear in her eyes 
 A riotous decision to choose 
 A careless man with no reason inside 
 He took the life out of you 
 A bitter end to a brief stay in life 
 I wish there was some way to choose 
 Why can't we choose? 
 We aren't here to stay 
 We're all the say way 
 See us fall away 
 I'll see you in the next life 
 25 with no reason to die 
 I know you should be right here 
 He paid the fine but never did any time 
 Why is this life so unfair? 
 We aren't here to stay 
 We're all the say way 
 See us fall away 
 I'll see you in the next life
########### Through My Eyes ###########
Tear through the ashes of what still remains 
 The blood runs down my face 
 Can't find the reason we're all left to waste 
 You must awaken 
 See through my eyes 
 I bleed to let myself know I'm alive 
 As you hide in denial 
 Break through the clouds and reach out to the sky 
 You must awaken 
 See through my eyes 
 See through my lies 
 We're not so far away 
 We're not so far away 
 As we crawl 
 To salvation, the rest try to hold us down 
 As they fall 
 We separate from the hate that will bring us down 
 Bring us down 
 Bring us down 
 These lacerations 
 They will reveal for the rest of my life 
 These aggravations 
 Will not conceal 'till I die or we end this fight 
 As we crawl 
 To salvation, the rest try to hold us down 
 As they fall 
 We separate from the hate that will bring us down 
 Forget the words that they've said 
 If its all deceit in your head 
 This life is more than just lies 
 Awake and see through my eyes 
 Awake and see through my eyes 
 Awake and see through my eyes 
 Awake and see through my eyes
########### The Beginning Of The End ###########
Realize the pain envision the fear 
 That goes on every year 
 Devour your pride acknowledge the hate 
 That we see everyday 
 Decide weather to fight for your rights or let life pass you by 
 Confide within the strength of yourself do not ever lay down and die 
 We're at the edge 
 We're closer to death 
 The beginning of the end 
 We are the ones who pay 
 We pay for your actions 
 We'll die again today 
 Unless we take action 
 Take all the strength from the weak 
 Find more ways to use them 
 Mankind does not have the right 
 Now we all must repent 
 We're at the edge 
 We're closer to death 
 The beginning of the end 
 We are the ones who pay 
 We pay for your actions 
 We'll die again today 
 Unless we take action 
 Now we must seek forgiveness 
 We we're all at the edge 
 We're closer to death 
 The beginning of the end
########### United We Stand ###########
Suffocate our will to survive 
 Eliminate the choice and divide us 
 Dissolution, self-confusion 
 Fall into the absence of mind 
 As you run away, away from all your fear 
 We'll stand right here 
 As you fall away, away from us this year 
 We'll stand right here 
 Its not complicated the life you once lead 
 The demon is in your head 
 I felt suffocated like I'd reached the end 
 But now united we stand 
 Now we stand 
 As you run away, away from all your fear 
 We'll stand right here 
 As you fall away, away from us this year 
 We'll stand right here 
 How long will you defend, the path you've chosen, the life that you've thrown away 
 Take this life in our hands, united we stand, this world becomes what we make it 
 Take this life in our hands, united we stand, this world will become what we make it
########### Beyond Recognition ###########
All hail the face of abomination 
 Deceive the minds of those 
 Who are sent to fight, who live their lives to die alone 
 We will succeed when you quit 
 The nation lost its patients 
 Lie us into war, trade blood for oil, we count the days 
 Emancipate from the sea of lies 
 Awaken and recognize the fate of mankind 
 Apocalyptic decay 
 Degeneration of all life as we know it, waste away 
 Live to die another day walking through this hell you've made 
 Our tears cannot be repaid 
 Slit through the wrist the blood running down my fingertips 
 I'd rather die than be slaved 
 You're planting the seeds of hate 
 For generations 
 Avoiding reality 
 Beyond Recognition 
 I'm reaching out towards the sky, begging for the answer 
 To see the truth, why they deserve to die 
 The innocent blood will shed 
 Eradication 
 Killing for your country 
 Beyond Recognition 
 I'm reaching out towards the sky, begging for the answer 
 To see the truth, why they deserve to die
########### Another Source Of Light ###########
Turn through the pages in my head 
 Remember what we had 
 Break through the shell you hide behind 
 Into the skin and see what the truth holds inside 
 I'll see what's behind your new eyes 
 And I will fight to keep myself alive 
 Without you I will find 
 Another source of light 
 Dissolve the memories in your head 
 Pretend like I was dead 
 And when you're looking for a friend 
 You'll turn around and miss all the people you had 
 And now they won't cover your back 
 And I will fight to keep myself alive 
 Without you I will find 
 Another source of light 
 Find your way back home 
 Your way back home 
 Find another source of light 
 Another source of light 
 Find another source of light 
 Another source of light
########### Hate Machine ###########
Man cannot predict the consequence 
 Feed into the hate machine and lead us to our own descent 
 We're trapped amidst conformity 
 The world is lost among itself its own obscurity 
 We must revive 
 Fall into a self induced demise 
 The strong become the powerless and now they struggle to survive 
 Do not neglect authority 
 The strength to save yourself or change all of humanity 
 We must unite and strive 
 As this world becomes our home 
 Its stripped and taken from our hands 
 And then we're slit to the bone 
 Take back these thorns around my neck 
 You'll wear them after 
 You will not see until I've been set free 
 The rein of power crushing down upon ourselves will decide the fate of life and mankind 
 The fall of man will rise and burn the skies unless we can find a way to all unite time 
 Now we must revive 
 As this world becomes our home 
 Its stripped and taken from our hands 
 And then we're slit to the bone 
 Take back these thorns around my neck 
 You'll wear them after 
 You will not see until I've been set free 
 We're not alone
########### Severed ###########
Stare down this road you travel on is this what you've dreamed your life would always be 
 I choose to learn from my mistakes decide my own fate not follow your disgrace 
 Its time you all take your own advice and stop pointing fingers 
 And as you all turn your back on me I will prove what I'm made of 
 Take back the bullshit that you've said 
 You're fooling no one but yourself 
 I know the answer lies inside 
 But now I have to say goodbye 
 And now I have to say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 And now I'm moving on 
 And now I'm moving strong 
 And now I'm moving on 
 Its time you all take your own advice and stop pointing fingers 
 And as you all turn your back on me I will prove what I'm made of 
 I will prove what I'm made of 
 Don't turn your back on me
########### Lost ###########
I'm running circles around my illusive head 
 Looking for an answer, a reason 
 I'm trying to figure out who is alive or dead 
 Is it me or is it everyone else instead? 
 Take a picture remember what I have said 
 Its in your mind don't ever deny 
 As I look into your eyes, I fear we are so blind 
 We're lost till the end of time 
 Never wanted to hear what they say 
 Never wanted to believe them anyway 
 My vision, this is my own 
 I'm looking for an answer I can't understand 
 Getting lost within myself 
 The human mind can never see or comprehend 
 If there is meaning to life after death 
 As I look into your eyes, I feel we are so blind 
 We're lost till the end of time 
 As I look beyond the sky, I see another life 
 We're lost till the end of time 
 We can be confused and question the life we ensue 
 I cannot describe this feeling I hold deep inside 
 What is there after life? Is this what we call life? How can we be so blind? 
 What if this is our lives? The pain we hold inside, in death we all will die 
 If it's our only life, don't waste all of your time, live life before you die
########### Revision ###########
See through the face of a thousand lies examine what your shown 
 Mass media will hide the truth don't believe what you're told 
 Their hidden agenda decides the way we live our lives 
 Deception clouds your mind now open your f****** eyes 
 Now we all must fight 
 And take back our lives 
 Now its do or die 
 Aggression is justified 
 It's your will for oppression that leads us to die in vain 
 We are the countless deceased laying buried beneath your flag 
 See through the pain of a thousand eyes acknowledge what you stole 
 Our nation built on lies won't stand for this anymore 
 Another fallen victim dies for what they thought was right 
 Regression builds inside now open your f****** eyes 
 Now we all must fight 
 And take back our lives 
 Now its do or die 
 Aggression is justified 
 Hate we will not enslave ourselves we must save population 
 Take back all of our rights 
 Now we all must fight 
 And take back our lives 
 Now its do or die 
 Aggression is justified 
 It's your will for oppression that leads us to die in vain 
 We are the countless deceased laying buried beneath your flag
########### In Repair ###########
I can't believe your face as I'm walking away 
 This image in my mind I can't erase 
 Its taken from the hands of fate (I can't believe your fate) 
 This sorrow implicates 
 An understanding of my hate (These words you can't erase) 
 Pure black inside 
 Right now I'm facing the end 
 Holding back the reason while you stare 
 These eyes cannot repair 
 Freedom shining through 
 Blind by all your fear 
 Its taken from the hands of fate (I can't believe your fate) 
 This sorrow implicates 
 An understanding of my hate (These words you can't erase) 
 Pure black inside 
 Right now I'm facing the end 
 Holding back the reason while you stare 
 These eyes cannot repair
########### Escape From Reality ###########
I'm reaching deeper inside myself again 
 To find the words to use 
 If I had one more chance I would realize 
 This isn't fair to you 
 I swear there's a better life 
 You are the answer to all my pain 
 Escape from my prison 
 Now I can breathe for another day 
 Escape from reality 
 You see the regret in my eyes 
 Feel my sincerity hear my cries 
 I will not sacrifice my life 
 For this uncertainty 
 I will choose what's right, what's mine 
 I swear there's a better life 
 You are the answer to all my pain 
 Escape from my prison 
 Now I can breathe for another day 
 Escape from reality 
 Surrender my apology 
 Even though we'll never be the same again 
 I have no reason left to say 
 Don't ever doubt that I am here to stay
########### To Remember ###########
Since when have you been confined to a worthless state of authority? 
 I'd rather chose a life designed for the free not owned by money and greed 
 Since when have you been so blind been enslaved to the corporate machine? 
 I'd rather take this life into my own hands not trust in conformity 
 Desensitized 
 Castrate the minds of the weak 
 Now visualize 
 Corruption lies and deceit 
 I will decide how to live my own life 
 When I die you will remember my name 
 There's no time to throw away your pride 
 Live your life as if your last was today 
 Live your life 
 Now step aside 
 Give us chance to revive 
 Our nation suffering 
 Never wait to decide 
 I will decide how to live my own life 
 When I die you will remember my name 
 There's no time to throw away your pride 
 Live your life as if your last was today 
 And when the end is here to stay 
 We'll have nothing left to say 
 This world is lost we'll fall apart 
 I'll die with you today
########### Uncensored ###########
This world is fucked 
 This world is fucked, we're born into hate 
 Kill ourselves over greed 
 This world is dead, if we never change 
 Slaughter life with deceit 
 Lie, rape, steal and murder 
 Kill or be killed 
 Repent for your sins 
 Life must resolve 
 Find help for us all 
 Don't censor life from my eyes 
 Don't censor me 
 We don't have the right to know 
 What we're fighting for 
 We don't have the right to know 
 Look beyond what media shows 
 There's something deeper, seek the truth 
 We have the right to know 
 Lie, rape, steal and murder 
 Kill or be killed 
 Repent for your sins 
 Life must resolve 
 Find help for us all 
 Hatred, disregard for life 
 Killing humanity 
 Shadow us in secrecy 
 We are servants to feed their greed 
 Fuck you
########### Comatose ###########
I awake to find myself in comatose 
 All these years I've been trapped and so blind 
 If nothing is real, than nothing is true 
 Trapped in a prison, confined without virtue 
 And I can't save myself 
 Dislocated from so called reality 
 I walk alone away from disease 
 My reflection dies 
 Killing my mind away tearing life out of me 
 And I can't save myself 
 Take all of this pain inside 
 And throw it all away 
 Take all of this hate inside 
 And kill it all away 
 Welcome to the abyss of my dementia 
 Am I awake or only breathing? 
 I feel nothing 
 I'm frozen inside and life is burning my mind away 
 And I can't save myself 
 Wake up 
 And I can't save myself 
 Take all of this pain inside 
 And throw it all away 
 Take all of this hate inside 
 And kill it all away 
 Take all of this pain inside 
 And kill it all away 
 Wake up 
 Wake up 
 Wake up
########### New World Order ###########
Realize there's something more than meets the eye 
 Hidden signs that justify propaganda, lies 
 You are told what to believe 
 Look beyond the face of reason and see the hate behind 
 Command the weak and send the strong to die 
 I won't kneel before this god 
 Take my rights 
 Take my pride 
 Just try to take them from me 
 Take my blood 
 Take my veins 
 But I'll take my soul with me 
 Starvation, war and disease are their plans to rid the earth 
 Depopulation plans ready to disperse 
 Speak now or forever hold your peace 
 Control us then break us down 
 Your sins won't wash away 
 Distractions lead us away and then keep our minds concealed 
 For those who have eyes to see, truth will be revealed 
 The signals of impending threat 
 Dictate society and turn us against ourselves 
 Subliminal thoughts alter all our mental health 
 I won't kneel before this god 
 Take my rights 
 Take my pride 
 Just try to take them from me 
 Take my blood 
 Take my veins 
 But I'll take my soul with me 
 Control us then break us down 
 Your sins won't wash away 
 Destroy us and kill us off 
 Your sins won't wash away 
 Controlled by fear 
 Their agenda will never be known until the twelfth hour has shown 
 A new world, a new order, big brother is watching us all
########### Trust In None ###########
Dislocate the enemies from your life 
 Remove all the hatred 
 Never trust in anyone, save yourself 
 Control is not lost 
 You choose the path you're on 
 Despite the reason 
 And I will never be held down 
 You live to feed, you serve for greed 
 Is that all you desire? 
 You fail yourself and no one else 
 You are prone for disaster 
 See through the prophecies and regain the faith you hide 
 You're just a slave, a victim; another machine inside 
 We are not the same 
 We will never be the same 
 You choose the path you're on 
 Despite the reason 
 And I will never be held down 
 You live to feed, you serve for greed 
 Is that all you desire? 
 You fail yourself and no one else 
 You are prone for disaster 
 Take control 
 I never trust in anyone 
 I never trust in anything
########### Face The Day ###########
Breathe me new life, I want nothing but strength 
 Take what is mine, here's my message to you 
 I will stay, I will not go, I'll wake from this nightmare and take back control 
 Break all of my bones, drag me through hell but I still have my soul 
 I own my soul 
 A change from weak to the wise 
 Alive and vigil from paralyzed 
 I will not die within 
 Face the day 
 Break from the chains that have bound me for years 
 See past the lies, you're the fucking disease 
 You're the fucking disease 
 I will stay, I will not go, I'll wake from this nightmare and take back control 
 Break all of my bones, drag me through hell but I still have my soul 
 I own my soul 
 A change from weak to the wise 
 Alive and vigil from paralyzed 
 I will not die within 
 Face the day 
 Stand up and fight some more 
 We must hold on, we all must be strong to end this fight 
 We can't be scared, we all must prepare to see the light 
 I never chose to live in fear 
 But I will never hide my face and I will never run away 
 I choose to face the day
########### Fallen Disciples ###########
A reign of terror burns across the black polluted sky 
 Darkness fills the air, hate consumed by every fear 
 Pray to the gods that you'll die 
 Living through this nightmare will ruin what is left of your mind 
 Fresh from the kill 
 Fallen disciples 
 Prey to the gods that you’ll die 
 Deface our world as you please 
 And now it's too late 
 Regret will not save this life 
 I'll watch you bleed as we die 
 When the gods call out my name 
 I'll rise from this hell today 
 My soul will ascend as my body slips away 
 The cries of fear will rise and not the blood is on your hands 
 Death will set us free, drain us of insanity 
 No one to bury the dead 
 Severed nations burning free, greed has brought you down to your knees 
 They will make us pay, the cost of war will repeat 
 I will not separate from my liberty 
 I'd give my life to set us free 
 And as our nation dies, when will you realize 
 Don't ever lie to save your pride 
 Deface our world as you please 
 And now it's too late 
 Regret will not save this life 
 I'll watch you bleed as we die 
 When the gods call out my name 
 I'll rise from this hell today 
 My soul will ascend as my body slips away
########### Disposition ###########
Raise your fist to the sky and show your pride 
 I am not divine I'm not heavenly 
 I seek to find the truth 
 I search for reason, for ecstasy 
 To face myself and face the world until I'm through 
 Time to wake up and fucking realize this is not a game 
 Your sacrilegious tunnel vision will not resolve the hate I despise 
 The hate I despise 
 I will sever my past today 
 I will not be judged for sins of yesterday 
 If all the shadows of light would come together unite 
 Control, this world – remove the faith in my eyes 
 Destroy, kill all – I'm not afraid to die 
 I will sever my past today 
 I will not be judged for sins of yesterday 
 If all the shadows of light would come together unite 
 I follow the path in my mind. I'll never retract 
 I choose my destiny, I'm never turning back 
 I can't ignore if all the pieces fit the light will show me the door 
 I will know when to rest my head until then I'll live life 
 Looking back upon my whole life 
 I realize I regret nothing 
 Every choice that I have made 
 Generates my life my love and all my pain 
 All my pain
########### Death Before Dishonor ###########
I pray for the end 
 The end of this nightmare that I' living in 
 I've lost all control 
 My mind has deceived me but I can't let go 
 And if the ashes of the flames 
 Could shadow eyes of hate 
 Our race might repent 
 The revelation could was all the blood away 
 I've watched them die 
 I've watched them live inside this lie 
 I've seen the blood and ignorance 
 I've seen death of innocence 
 Break all the trust that we have made 
 Kill all the hope inside of me 
 Burn in this hell that you've made out of greed 
 Drown in the blood of deceit 
 Why believe that we could change? 
 See through the fallacy 
 It's all what you believe 
 Our retribution lives in the flesh 
 We kill our own disease 
 See through the tyranny 
 They made us fucking believe 
 Our reprisal lives flesh 
 We kill our own disease 
 We live undead 
 We can't forget the past 
 We are not blind 
 We will revive 
 We are not dead 
 We are not blind
########### Buried Alive ###########
Don't cover my eyes with your secrecy 
 I have a right to know, what you plan for this world 
 Decisions altering serenity 
 I fear the unknown 
 Can we be disposed? 
 Don't tie the noose around my neck 
 Dislocate society, killing all of my respect 
 Don't carve X's in my eyes 
 Hide me from the truth I seek 
 Feed me lies upon more lies 
 I will not be the one to ignore what they've done 
 Don't bury me 
 I will not run and hide, they’ll find the truth inside 
 Don't bury me 
 "The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society, and we are as a 
 people, inherently and historically, apposed to secret societies, to secret 
 oaths, and to secret proceedings. The government at all levels must meet its 
 obligation to provide you with the fullest possible information. With your 
 help, man will be what he was born to be, free and independent." 
 (John F. Kennedy) 
 Fight back 
 Fight back 
 Denial threatening humanity 
 I won't play the pain in their conspiracy 
 Your government will never save you now 
 Their puppets encaged 
 Spreading the hate 
 I will not live my whole life, feeding the machine 
 Free us from greed 
 Free us from pain 
 Free us from hate 
 Free us today
########### Resistance ###########
Your mind is controlled 
 Accept what you see, believe what your told 
 Free space! Free choice! Find a reason to use your voice! 
 Acknowledge the guilty, they plan to run the world 
 Absolute power corrupts, absolutely! 
 I will not conform! 
 We're terrified to know the answers 
 We're all convinced to think that we all know what this life holds 
 I resist! 
 You walk into lies, the world as we know it destroyed inside 
 Resist, fight back! We must reclaim the faith we hide! 
 Acknowledge the wealthy, they plan to ruin the world 
 Absolute power corrupts, absolutely 
 I will not conform! 
 We're terrified to know the answers 
 We're all convinced to think that we all know what this life holds 
 I resist! 
 We must speak the truth of the world 
 There's more than life than what we're told 
 Free space! Free choice! Find a reason to use your voice! 
 I will not conform! 
 We're terrified to know the answers 
 We're all convinced to think that we all know what this life holds
########### A New Begining ###########
Face down on the way to the end 
 I'm fighting to breathe, don't bury me 
 Consume our lives, control our minds 
 I've taken the strength that was left behind 
 I'm pulling deeper from within 
 (Deeper from within) 
 The answers bleeding through my skin 
 Serenity dies if I could breathe again 
 (If I could breathe again) 
 I'd choose a new beginning 
 (A new beginning) 
 Salvation will save us all 
 The lacerations will heal 
 Rise beyond the threshold 
 Surpass all obstruction, we will survive 
 I'm pulling deeper from within 
 (Deeper from within) 
 The answers bleeding through my skin 
 Serenity dies if I could breathe again 
 (If I could breathe again) 
 I'd choose a new beginning 
 (A new beginning) 
 I'm falling away from this artificial life 
 Omit treason cast upon thee 
 My revelations, beginning a new life
########### The Illusionist ###########
I have embraced your innocence 
 I've been cut through the flesh 
 And I can resist, building life again 
 Drawn back to the edge 
 To the essence of my fear 
 With every ounce of strength 
 I intend to survive this life 
 And we are shaped 
 Into a mold that we can't choose 
 Deception will bury us all 
 Animosity 
 For the actions 
 That kill all respect and desire 
 Drawn back to the edge 
 To the essence of my fear 
 With every ounce of strength 
 I intend to survive this life 
 And we are shaped into 
 A mold that we can't choose 
 And we are hopeless now 
 Bring back the day 
 And we are hopeless now 
 I'm lost again 
 Dead inside 
 Drowning without you now 
 Lost again 
 Drowning without your love 
 Dead inside 
 Dead inside your eyes 
 Lost again 
 Dying without you

########### Perturbed ###########
Obesession, old demons who defeat you 
 I search, greedy for calm, my liberty 
 Let the amoeba devour you 
 It's your requiem 
 The racked guided spirit by the past, 
 Voodoed by this pity witch freeze my veins. 
 Ridiculousness 
 This obsession is yours, individual 
 Invented or hidden, justified or inordinate 
 Your eyes give away and this secret so well kept 
 This languidness, suffering from hurt you so much 
 These perturbed sensations 
 Macabre mass of my look towards the future 
 Respect your vision of huminity respect man who regard you 
 Respect these men who look at you 
 These memories which spoil life
########### Fate ###########
Look at my fight, feel my hate and my rage 
 Follow with your eye, 
 And contemplate the ethics of the determination 
 A kind of self-mutilation condition which develops and demolishes you, 
 Some people are jealous of it, others use it, I see it, like my guide. 
 Look at my fight, feel my hate and my rage 
 Follow with your eye, 
 And contemplate the ethics of the determination, 
 I walk all my flesh follows this fluid which leaves my spirit away 
 Tp frredom and quiet towards your own artificial light 
 You are the architect of your own fate, your own destiniy, 
 You lead it or you destroy it 
 Impregnate you, what nature has made of you 
 This is my god, my way of the cross, this is my religion 
 This is my vision, this is the secret of my freedom and peace 
 Look at my fight, feel my hate and my rage 
 Follow with your eye, 
 And contemplate the ethics of the determination 
 This is my god, my way of the cross, this is my religion 
 This is my vision, this is the secret of my freedom and peace 
 Look at my fight, feel my hate and my rage 
 Follow with your eye, 
 And contemplate the ethics of the determination
########### Vision Of Hate ###########
Experiance of life after recovering from one's fright 
 You have find, your nobility of soul. 
 To go from one extreme, you're afraid 
 This size, gazing into infinity to make a leap into the unknown 
 Here it's answer, our question, 
 Our fear, our panic in our deepest being 
 You're afraid. 
 Fear lent our wings to be scarred stiff at the idea of doing a leap into the unknown 
 You're afraid of vision of height. 
 Afraid, to go from one extreme, of height, to the other, Afraid, Fear lent our wings, 
 Of height, our fear, our panic, Afraid. 
 Experiance of life after recovering from one's fright 
 You have find, your nobility of soul. 
 Fear lent our wings 
 You're afraid of vision of height. 
 Afraid, to go from one extreme, of height to the other, 
 Afraid, Fear lent our wings, of height, 
 Our fear, our panic, Afraid.

Pa ké, pa ké, pa ké seguir llorando pa ké 
 Pa ké, pa ké, pa ké seguir llorando pa ké 
 Seguir llorando... 
 Las penas y las alegrías 
 A todos van acompasando 
 Y al escuchar los quejíos 
 Los ancianos van cantando... 
 Rueda de carro es mi bandera 
 Buscando libertad 
 Buscando tierra 
 Tirando paquí tirando pallá 
 Asentando leyendas 
 Rueda de la fortuna 
 Me dejaste mas sola que la una 
 Rueda de la fortuna dime!!! 
 Hasta cuando las ataduras 
 Que importa lo que diga la gente 
 Si seguimos trazando trayectorias diferentes 
 Oído que no escucha no siente 
 Eso es lo que vi!!! 
 Que importa lo que diga la gente 
 Si seguimos trazando trayectorias diferentes 
 Boca que no habla no miente 
 Eso es lo que vi!! Eso es lo que vi!!! Eso es lo que vi!!!
########### Cycle ###########
To be reborn again in the universal cycle. 
 Our action ressurects life ingesting his decent offspring. 
 My presence begets this life 
 Transformation 
 The putrefaction of the being living 
 To be reborn again in the universal cycle. 
 Full of electron I do relive elements. 
 The dead is the start of my life. 
 My role, the fragile equilibrium of this life. 
 I let off of everything and cut and dried part of me.
########### Deprived Of Soul ###########
We're buried under man's hand, we've been digged up by our ancestors. 
 Unaware of the dephts of the human psyche. 
 We fall bad, we don't feel our roots anymore. 
 Nature hears us and we seem indifferent. 
 This resonance inside of our person calls us. 
 The horror of human nature stops us believing. 
 Nothing is impossible

 Death don't exist 
 Depths and abysses full of cells

########### On The Threshold Of Death ###########
Your bloody body, the evil which eating away at you. 
 Without sensation, you let yourself be persuaded, you fight to the bitter end. 
 Your scars remind you of who you are. 
 Motionless, you are attracted by the void, this sensation calms you. 
 Leaving aside you, you can push back your limits. 
 Do you feel you can contain this pain? 
 Your freezes your blood in your veins, 
 Time is stopping, the moment freezes. 
 Forget your body, release sensation of death. 
 Free your mind, you will know your limits. 
 Your bloody body 
 A new life reveals to you. 
 Your way 
 Your hate freezes your blood in your veins, 
 Lost your way 
 Time is stopping, the moment freezes 
 These pains remind, you are
########### To Walk Among Them ###########
I want to burst and to be free. 
 I went too far, I can't back down. 
 Growing up in a senseless world. 
 My spirit is lost. 
 People look at me like a special man. 
 You're my friend, you feel my despair. 
 You're my mother, your blood is flowing in my veins. 
 I confront people with my conviction. 
 I feel undesirable and misunderstood. 
 All those eyes stare at me and judge me without knowing me. 
 Are they afraid of me, are they afraid of my thoughts? 
 Are they afraid of me or frightened by my beliefs? 
 I live in this dark system. 
 Where the truth. Where the lies. 
 Lost in this senseless world, from which I try to escape. 
 I feel cast-off. I feel undesirable. 
 I'm lost in this senseless world. 
 I live in this senseless world. 
 I find my way. 
 "Stop your revenge. We are the same. We are all like you, we stay in front of you." 
 I find my way. I find the way. 
 I don't see the reality. 
 I transform it according to my feelings. 
 Would I be lost forever? 
 The human condition is my goal and it's lies are my chains. 
 Come and set me free. 
 Set me free. [x4] 
 Save me. 
 You're my friend, you feel my despair. 
 You're my mother, your blood is flowing in my veins. 
 You're my friend, you stop my pain. 
 You're my brother, you know my scars. 
 I suffocate because of this environment. 
 I can't remove these masks, am I lost for all eternity? 
 This environment kills me. 
 I can't breathe anymore. 
 All those contradictions kill me and I put my fate into my human condition.
########### Act Of God ###########
You believe in this fake reality so you can go and destroy. 
 Men organize wars and slaughters. 
 But I will be in front of you. 
 Nothing can… Nothing can calm me. 
 You do not deserve to live. 
 Only your blood relieves me. 
 I know it’s inside of you. 
 I know it’s inside of me and death doesn’t frighten me. 
 Each man has this survival instinct, inside of him. 
 I know it’s inside of me and death doesn’t frighten me. 
 You have to make your own choice. 
 You have to take on your decisions. 
 Are you afraid 
 The human world is so violent. 
 It can’t prevent the violence of men. 
 My liberty; my freedom is priceless. 
 Keep me, I don’t think my actions make me act. 
 I feel worse. 
 You have to take on your decisions and their consequences. 
 Nature is more powerful than all these corrupt values in which you believe.

I see this world as it is. 
 I can't help being afraid. 
 We are locked up in a virtual world. 
 I'm afraid of our civilization; seems to be war and destruction. 
 Power of men. Power of end.

########### A World Of Lies ###########
We are not the element which revolutionized life on Earth. 
 We have the conscience and we destroy ourselves. 
 We are in the same world and we destroy ourselves. 
 Mind the amoeba, mysterious and strong, it develops, divides into two, focused and eternal. 
 In the middle of the others my mask protects me but I begin to go crazy. 
 We are not the element. 
 Mind the amoeba, mysterious and strong, it develops, divides into two. 
 Being one of them, I need my mask to protect. 
 But my arm's getting weak; I feel it hard to hold. 
 I'm losing myself again. 
 I'm scarred. I'm fascinated. 
 Complex mechanism of life. 
 I'm scarred. I'm fascinated. 
 Man destroys himself. Insane. Insane. 
 Please mother give me the strength to carry on in this world of lies. 
 My failure would be their victory. 
 Don't let me get insane. 
 I am losing myself again. 
 Don't let me get insane.

########### Awakening ###########
I see the balance of things, I admire it, but man is insensible to this. 
 He doesn't care about us. 
 Is it our quest of progress? 
 We are not the element which has revolutionized life on Earth. 
 I see the balance of things, I admire it, but man is insensible to this. 
 That he, master builder of his own rotten shelter, is not not master creator. 
 Creation of my imagination. Creation of my imagination. 
 Your suffering can change everything in your life. 
 See who your friends are. 
 Creation of my imagination. 
 What are men able to do for the power? 
 He doesn't care about us. 
 Is it our quest of progress? 
 We are not the element which has revolutionized life on Earth.
########### My Enemy ###########
I redefine my own rules and I'm driven by an animal drive. 
 I feel they were hostile towards me. 
 I avoid the other people. 
 All these contradictions make me want to kill. 
 I want the good and I see the evil. 
 I can't stay without saying. 
 Look in my eyes and see the strength of my fight. 
 Money and power destroys us. 
 No matter, all these rules are imposed on me. 
 Look in my eyes; the power of rage. 
 Many men die while others grow fat and take advantage. 
 I fight for my own cause. 
 Nothing will stop me. 
 I can't stay without saying; all those things make me want to kill. 
 I run away from the others. 
 I can't stay without saying; all these contradictions make me want to kill. 
 I run away from the others. 
 Nothing will stop me; I run away from the others. 
 I don't give a shit about those rules you try to impose on me. 
 You're my enemy. I'm my enemy. 
 All these contradictions make me want to kill. 
 I want the good and I see the evil. 
 I can't stay without saying. 
 Alone, facing my thoughts. 
 My dreams are disturbed. 
 Infinite vision. I cry. 
 Alone, facing my thoughts. 
 Alone, infinite vision. 
 My close relations are watching me. 
 Myself, save you.
########### Introversion ###########
All our promises have been erased by the weight of time, 
 And all the dreams we shared have been replaced by a numbing need to fit in! 
 This machine has destroyed my aspirations and it’s eating me alive day after day… 
 Scarred by a society crawling under rules and regulations, 
 Respect the chain of command or get out of here! 
 There’s no space left for the animal inside (of us) and our suffering is constant, 
 I wanna shake up their codes, but I mean nothing to them! 
 I don’t belong here, 
 I’m not part of your fucking world! 
 You don’t know who I am, 
 So don’t patronize me! 
 I’m a passenger in their world, 
 And I’ve become a stranger to my own life…
########### Strive Ever To More ###########
I’m stuck in here and cannot look around, 
 I’m doing time for your sake! 
 Trapped inside a cell I cannot move around, 
 Feeling so hollow… 
 You can lock me down, 
 But I’ll live to tell the tale. 
 You can’t control my fury, 
 For nature will always take over! 
 The flame burns bright, 
 Reach out for the strength inside… 
 Find this impulse that makes you strive ever to more! 
 Trying to control me is fucking useless, 
 Cause I’ve got nothing to lose now! 
 Too many tears have been shed to go back now, 
 I’m not alone... 
 You cannot rule my realm! 
 Your world is on fire, 
 Consumed by deception we will never learn to (truly) make peace. 
 Man was born from treason, 
 Let rage take over my sanity! 
 Stop feeling out of place, 
 You can’t draw a line between you and your family. 
 You are what we say you are, 
 And that’s why you can’t stop falling into negativity! 
 My sweet shelter of darkness… 
 The flame burns bright, 
 Reach out for the strength within... 
 Find this impulse that makes you strive ever to more!
########### Overcome ###########
I never believed in fate, 
 We make our destiny! 
 Always rising above fears and frustrations… 
 You’ve been tamed for too long: 
 Confront your demons! 
 We are the shadows of our needs, 
 A series of wasted dreams, 
 We deny our longing for self-destruction, 
 And try to conceal it for it scares us! 
 I can see the light, 
 When the oppression is gone… 
 This is the final call, 
 I’m on the edge! 
 Overcome! 
 Stare into the eye and you’ll overcome fear, 
 I’m my own monster. 
 Forget everything you know and drown in nothingness… 
 Let the void absorb anger and rage! 
 Look deep into your soul and face the enemy… 
 I can see the light, 
 And the oppression is gone, 
 This is the final call … 
 I’m on the edge! 
 I’m on the edge of breaking down, 
 I’m on the edge and falling down, 
 I can’t come back and I know it!
########### Edification Of The Fall ###########
"I can clearly see now that there is no universal code of ethics, 
 The world that we created is falling apart and I can see through the lies.” 
 Rising over the years of sorrow, 
 Nothing’s like it used to be. 
 Corrupted by their crooked smiles, 
 Dragged down by force... 
 Give up all I want from you, 
 Edification of the fall! 
 One’s failure too often makes the other’s pride, 
 In a binary system of winners and losers… 
 There is no success, 
 There are no greater men, 
 They wanna watch you fail! 
 They need to watch you fail to exist! 
 “You can’t buy happiness, 
 No matter how hard they try to sell it to you…” 
 Free from the path that I chose so long ago, 
 No longer serving… 
 Breaking the seal of destiny! 
 Corrupted by their crooked smiles, 
 Dragged down by force... 
 Give up all I want from you, 
 Edification of the fall!
########### Ghosts Of The Modern World ###########
How could god/man make life so empty? 
 This world is controlled by money and power. 
 Our hunger is limitless and defies reality, 
 We're heading for the wall but the machine goes too fast to change course! 
 Look at me! 
 I'm a broken man… 
 Self-respect has been traded for regrets: The only feelings that last! 
 And the only thing I feel today is a bitter sense of sadness… 
 We are the ghosts of the modern world, 
 The denial of human nature! 
 Feeling isolated more and more, 
 Today is like yesterday because my days are the same! 
 I’m chained like a dog… 
 I was raised in an illusion and now I’m trapped inside myself… 
 The mold that I was forced into was never meant for me. 
 We’re not free and never will be… 
 Nothing can satisfy me, 
 Nothing can quench my thirst…
########### Requiem For A Lullaby ###########
“I relive the same dream over and over again, 
 Watching with satisfaction a fulfilled and better version of me… 
 Can I hold onto something real or must I live in eternal sleep? 
 Sometimes I wish I did not wake up from this dream!” 
 Haunted by defeat I revive the old wounds again, 
 Alone and facing the day I turned my back on passion (for good)…. 
 …And I know that it’s too late, 
 That time will consume us all. 
 I’ve missed my entire life, 
 And I’m slowly turning into dust… 
 My life is damned and my hopes are gone, 
 I’ll never find the peace of mind that I need… 
 Torn with anguish, my mind is confused. 
 Our creations seem superficial compared to the hardships we have to overcome. 
 There is no turning back, 
 Salvation is at hand…. 
 Hear my words or fall. 
 Hear my words or keep on dreaming. 
 Stand for yourself and fight for real, 
 Lead your path to a brighter day! 
 Nothing can go wrong as long as you keep on trying. 
 Building up your confidence day by day and (always) giving it your best shot! 
 The world is yours! 
 Redefine your vision, 
 Redefine your vision and dare to take a chance! 
 Become who you are meant to be! 
 Become who you are meant to be before you turn into dust…

########### Lionize ###########
Eyes, I lionize eyes that uphold just 
 That see deeper beyond 
 Seek the honest 
 Devote assistance to the wounded 
 And the naked 
 Pure devotion overwhelms 
 The hollow actions 
 That limit pure ambitions to prevail 
 Lionize eyes that see 
 Shape me to master 
 Surround me to feel 
 Armour the foundation 
 Rebuild on solid ground 
 Eyes, I lionize eyes that uphold just 
 That see deeper beyond

 Devote assistance to the wounded

 Armour the foundation 
 Rebuild on solid ground 
 Sow the new in me something that will remain 
 Spread your shine and let it rain again 
 Oooh 
 Armour the foundation 
 Rebuild on solid ground 
 Sow the new in me that will remain 
 Spread your shine and let it rain again 
 Sow the new in me that will remain

 All, I lionize all that unfolds just 
 That moves deeper beyond 
 Seeks the honest 
 Pure devotion overwhelms 
 Hollow, distorted 
 I lionize all that seeks

Two sets of footprints 
 Close to each other on the ground 
 Together forever 
 Nothing seems and nothing feels impossible anymore 
 Arms wide open 
 To everything that the future will bring 
 Time takes us further without fear 
 Without dread of tomorrow 
 Never alone, never 
 No we will never be alone 
 Distances can never 
 Keep us apart 
 Two hearts beating as one 
 So close no matter how far 
 Time takes us further without fear 
 Without dread of tomorrow 
 Never alone, never 
 No we will never be... 
 Time takes us further without fear 
 Without dread of tomorrow 
 Never alone, never 
 No we will never be alone 
 Unexplainable two way emotion 
 Unconditional devotion 
 Naked confession of love and affection 
 Of our love I will sing 
 You and me, always 
 You and me 
 It feels like even more than it sounds like 
 Unexplainable two way emotion 
 Unconditional devotion 
 Naked confession of love and affection 
 Of our love I will sing

########### Burning Hands ###########
Spirit speak 
 Our nature binds us in dark chains from saving ourselves - We bring about our own end - In flames we will burrow with our burning hands - digging distance into the eternity of damnation 
 But there must be a savior 
 A mighty warrior delivering those who deny themselves and bow before Him 
 Then I see the Lord - Towering over me he says - "I am the Alpha and Omega, beginning and the end - To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life." 
 Oh, I weep with repentance - I hear the Christ knocking and open I will overcome by His strength - I will sit aside the throne with Him. 
 (Revelation 21:6)
########### Immersed ###########
The victory of Jesus 
 Unfading light divine 
 Unto the truth open your eyes 
 Lord of heaven and earth 
 Pour the blood of Jesus over us 
 As His enemies watch 
 Their strongholds fall 
 Their skin is burnt by righteousness 
 The holy flame devours 
 The flesh of demons scorch 
 We have seen your victory 
 We have taken victory 
 Spirit of God be overflowing 
 Saints be empowered 
 We have seen your victory 
 We have taken victory
########### Precursing The Final Milennia ###########
When the thousand years are over 
 Satan will be released 
 From his prison 
 He will go out to deceive the nations 
 In the four corners of the earth 
 Patiently we wait 
 Against unrelenting assault 
 Minions gather to march the earth 
 Surrounding God's people 
 Then the Christ will descend in glorious light 
 With eyes like blazing fire 
 Surrounded by the entire army of Heaven 
 And how wild the flames that consumed 
 The great deceiver and his legions 
 Like ashes of sulfur, turned to dust 
 Let it be known that our God will be victorious 
 Amen 
 Come Lord Jesus 
 His grace be with us 
 Amen, come Lord Jesus 
 His grace be with God's people
########### Death Was Defeated ###########
War - It's coming - Death was defeated - On which 
 side will you stand. 
 He walks the ruins of Babylon - Where there is light - There is no darkness. 
 Will you be the dust on the ground - The snake under his feet. 
 Come my Savior - stand among us. 
 War - It's coming - Death was defeated - On which side will you stand? 
 He walks the ruins of Babylon - Where there is light - There

 Will you be the dust on the ground - The snake under his feet? 
 Come my Savior, stand among us 
 Come fight - On which side will you stand?
########### You Who Are Broken ###########
I lie on the floor paralyzed 
 Mocked for crying out for assistance 
 I am in need of a healer 
 A savior above all things 
 Fear in my emotions 
 Soon I will perish 
 Why do you entertain evil thoughts 
 He says to the mockers he knows 
 You who are broken 
 He's waiting 
 Bow before him 
 The throne of God 
 The man before you is the son of God 
 We kneel down unto him 
 On our knees 
 Son of God

Lord you have been our dwelling place 
 The fires of the acolytes are burning 
 A gathering of believers

 The spirit resides in the 
 Dwelling place of His followers 
 The weak and the zealous 
 In all who believe 
 In all who believe 
 Lord you have been our dwelling place 
 He is the sun 
 The radiant guide 
 Revealing Himself to those who do not seek 
 Constantly with open arms 
 Obstinate people 
 Pursuing your own imaginations 
 Oh that you would burst from the heavens 
 And come down from your throne 
 How the mounatins would quake in Your presence 
 With the spirit 
 Let rebuilding begin 
 Bestow healing 
 Mend our souls 
 Oh that you would burst from the heavens 
 And come down from Your throne
########### Forged In Perfect Design ###########
A promise since before the world began 
 And this will be Your 
 New kingdom of perfection 
 The inheritance of eternal life 
 From His fingers 
 A new heaven and earth 
 The old is lost and forgotten 
 No more will the walls echo with weeping 
 Will death have strength over life 
 Rest comes for those who dwell on the mountain 
 For theirs is the protected place 
 The old order will be dismantled 
 A promise since before the world began 
 And this will be Your 
 New kingdom of perfection 
 The inheritance of eternal life 
 Never again will a child live only a few days 
 Descendants will live with their elders 
 And he who sees a hundred years 
 Will be youthful 
 The old order will be dismantled 
 Abolishment of human nature 
 Free from death, suffering, and sin 
 God help the souls of those who 
 Exclude you because of His name 
 And will sit outside the gates
########### Ab Aeterno ###########
Where are they walking? - Scales in their eyes - We see the people of the world shake - They tremble when you hide. 
 All of life - All existence - From your fingers - Is creation 
 When the darkness surrounds me - You shine your light in so brightly - Giving the will to move on - Your power reigns over all. 
 All of life - All existence - From your fingers - Is creation

########### Fool Me ###########
You never come when I call you 
 You're always there with a smile 
 I'm only here to prepare you 
 For this grim some time 
 I said you look so hollow 
 You're never there with a smile 
 Take it all down with you 
 Make it worth your while 
 You cannot fool me 
 So just runaway, runaway 
 You never come when I call you 
 I see the look in your eyes 
 I know you just won't help me 
 I know you just won't try 
 So what if they don't listen 
 So what if they don't care 
 So what if I need you 
 Ain't nothing left out here 
 You cannot fool me 
 So just runaway, runaway 
 With me, while begging you please 
 Run with me 
 I know what you want inside 
 Longing you look to hide 
 Running away from here 
 Take it or leave it now 
 Your chance is up somehow 
 Running so blind and scared 
 I came here to say today 
 You're fucked up in every way 
 Wrap it up with your abuse 
 Nothing here can cut you loose 
 Run, run, run away if you dare 
 I see that sweat I know you're there 
 Looking back on this ordeal 
 It doesn't matter to me
########### Konkrete Seed ###########
I see you with the bitter light 
 And a candle burns here by my side 
 So I found a place where I can stay here for the night 
 Hope you feel the same 
 When I wake next to you 
 God knows why I'm still here 
 Why I'm still here with you 
 All that you left here 
 All that you own 
 Nothing was left here 
 Nothing has grown 
 So go on your own 
 Play by yourself 
 And give it to me 
 I know that you won't blame me 
 You shame me 
 Your eyes they told 
 And you don't call in 
 Save your soul 
 You run around 
 And you don't call in 
 By now you surely should have realised 
 What's done is done and you cannot reverse 
 Now the seed is sown 
 To late your time is up anyway 
 Your chance has passed to make a pet of me 
 Now the seed is sown 
 All that you gave her 
 All that you own 
 Nothing was safe here 
 Nothing has grown 
 So go on your own 
 Say what you feel 
 Leave it to me 
 I know that you won't blame me 
 You shame me 
 Your eyes they told 
 And you don't call in 
 Save your soul 
 You run around 
 And you don't call in 
 By now you surely should have realised 
 What's done is done and you cannot reverse 
 Now the seed is sown 
 To late your time is up anyway 
 Your chance has passed to make a pet of me 
 Now the seed is sown 
 What is the problem 
 What is this noise 
 This is the way here 
 So bring on the boys 
 Time is a weapon 
 Time is a tool 
 You take what I give you 
 Yes you put it to use 
 For you 
 So I say to myself yes I'm never going back 
 Got the rocks to my face kind of smokey in my back 
 And it seems to my mind there's something quite so clear 
 Listen to the face and rip it up in fear 
 But you let go 
 Settle for the back row 
 You were never there for 
 Can't, but you see what you be 
 Did you want me 
 Don't want to be me 
 Listen to your hedge row 
 Motherfucker it's not fair 
 But you want it, you need it, you see it 
 You're trying hard to beat it 
 Don't steal it, don't feed it 
 So what comes next 
 One last breath before I dive 
 Deep into your anger ocean 
 Just one taste I beg you please 
 Just one taste of your sweat potion 
 You shame me 
 Your eyes they told 
 And you don't call in 
 Save your soul 
 You run around 
 And you don't call in 
 By now you surely should have realised 
 What's done is done and you cannot reverse 
 Now the seed is sown 
 To late your time is up anyway 
 Your chance has passed to make a pet of me 
 Now the seed is sown 
 Yes I'm trying to make it on my own 
 Yes I'm trying to make it to my home

Hahahahaha you're beat 
 Hahahahaha you're beat 
 Hahahahaha you're beat 
 Take a look at your own face 
 To see it's a disgrace 
 To know what you held in your hand 
 What you see is your own fear 
 There's nothing to see here 
 There's nothing you want, but you will 
 To know if you want to 
 To know if you have to 
 To make this decision on your own 
 Always look and disturb me 
 To see if you beat me 
 I know you'll try but you won't win 
 You live this lie every day 
 There's nothing here for me to say 
 It doesn't matter anyway 
 'cause I don't give a fuck 
 So this is the calling 
 Yes this is the warning 
 I'm letting you know where you stand 
 You took me for granted 
 You said that I planned it 
 Don't dump your shit back on me 
 You got what you came for 
 To settle your own score 
 You're living this life in a dream 
 So run with your eyes closed 
 I hope that you won't fall 
 The reason to find me in the end 
 You live this lie every day 
 There's nothing here for me to say 
 It doesn't matter anyway 
 'cause I don't give a fuck about you 
 You see, lie lonely 
 I try, you build me 
 You live this lie every day 
 There's nothing here for me to say 
 It doesn't matter anyway 
 'cause I don't give a fuck 
 You run, you hide 
 You know you can't decide 
 Which way to turn so you might as well stay 
 What the fuck did you say 
 What the fuck did you say 
 What the fuck did you say 
 Oi, I say what the fuck

 I suppose this question will be answered 
 and I suppose the answers are here to save us 
 Have you heard have you listened lately? 
 Single word, single vowel, yet nothing frustrates me 
 Now I don't think you like me now 
 Now I don't think you like me now 
 Have you heard, its a silent dream 
 it chooses the weather, of your soul stream 
 so drop me down, let me feel this either way 
 face me inside, with a broken view, a broken heart, disappear 
 Now I don't think you like me now 
 Now I don't think you're like me now 
 Hold it, Hold it 
 I won't leave you 
 Now hold it down, please 
 Ahhh ohhh, ahhh ohhh 
 Sing alone, sing aloud, to be alive, its so good to feel you near 
 swim alone, live a dream, see me drown, all this in apathy 
 Be still for a moment 
 so you can face this world, you face it all for a moment 
 so you can face this world, you face this world 
 Hold it, Hold it 
 I won't leave you 
 Now hold it down, please

Step in this room where I wanna be 
 Surely you mean this something 
 You're bringing me down to a silent breath 
 When it's the truth that I wanna see 
 Search myself for the reason 
 The ever loving greed 
 I am put off slighty 
 So what am I to see (in the sensory, serenity) 
 Oh my love (in the sensory, serenity) 
 So pull the pin inside 
 Baby let it ride 
 Never knowin' I'm the next to see 
 With the fire sign 
 Never make it mine 
 Never knowin' I'm the next to be 
 I am learning slowly 
 So what am I to see 
 Every twist and turning 
 Through my hypocrisy 
 It's so good to see 
 This world is alive 
 It's so good to see 
 This world is a lie 
 Like a knot it binds 
 Suffocating minds 
 Never knowing I'm in the next to see 
 With the fire sign 
 Never make it mine 
 Never knowing I'm the next to bleed 
 I am learning slowly 
 So what am I to see 
 Every twist and turning 
 Through my hypocrisy 
 Search myself for the reason 
 Forever loving greed 
 I am bored of silence 
 So what am I to see? 
 It's so good to see 
 This world is alive 
 It's so good to see 
 This world is a lie 
 Lie awake, still, as I try to breathe 
 Surely you mean this is something 
 You're bringing me down to a silent breath 
 And it's the truth that I wanna see 
 (In the sensory serenity 
 In the sensory serenity) 
 In the sensory, serenity 
 How could it be, that I'm the next to see? 
 In the sensory, serenity 
 How could it be, that I'm the next to see? 
 In the sensory, serenity 
 How could it be, that I'm the next to see? 
 In the sensory, serenity 
 Could it be, that I'm in ecstasy? 
 It's so good to see 
 This world is alive 
 It's so good to see 
 This world is a lie 
 It's so good to see (so good to see) 
 This world I'm in... (world I'm in/world I'm in/world I'm in loves me) 
 So...

Leave me alone 
 I'm seething 
 I search for the truth and love in your eyes 
 Help me to feel I'm needed 
 I search for the truth to find you mine 
 Bust myself back into pieces 
 I pull at the seam as you start to tear 
 Lead myself back to a coma shell 
 No better, face left too bare 
 I see more than you 
 And I feel more than you 
 You're spinning me out 
 It's a better room now, it's a better place 
 I, I would beg you to scream at me 
 The voices cry, the fashion mould 
 They want the truth, not what it seems 
 Bust myself back into pieces 
 I pull at the seam as you start to tear 
 Lead myself back to a coma shell 
 No better, face left too bare 
 I see more than you (more than) 
 And I feel more than you (more than) 
 You're spinning me out 
 Speak to me now 
 With guarded tongue 
 See through me now 
 Look what you've done 
 I see more than you (more than you) 
 And I feel more than you (more than you) 
 Scrape me from the ceiling (I see more) 
 These suckers want more (than you) 
 I feel the pressure belonging to all 
 Put fear into my mind (I see more) 
 I'm open to everything (than you) 
 I feel the strength of you (more than you) 
 Give me this feeling I need, yeah (more than you) 
 It's a better room now 
 It's a better place (more than you) 
 I feel more than you

 All you fear now is won 
 A concious world will spin you in and out of time 
 Lend your breath to broken sail 
 Hands up in my blunted nail 
 Rolling water, suck her free 
 Surely I can make you feel 
 What I'm feeling, falling in 
 Comfort bleeds a swollen mend 
 In the secrecy that is to lie 
 Knowing in failure, will I 
 Forge the wrong sound? 
 Soon I see what they mean 
 Living this fallacy 
 Promised heaven, I concede 
 Dead, what I'm feeling, falling in 
 Comfort bleeds a swollen mend 
 In the secrecy that is to lie 
 Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your eyes 
 With you in mind, with you in time 
 Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your head 
 Dead, what I'm feeling, falling in 
 Comfort bleeds a swollen mend 
 In the secrecy that it's to lie 
 That is to lie 
 Stare blind at the sun, feel the warmth in your eyes

You want to chase this rabbit down a hole 
 You start to slide and lose grip of control

 You'll bury this, slow down 
 It's all this system breeds 
 You'll bury this, slow down 
 It's time to make amends 
 Save your eyes for this place 
 Where I define you: myth or desire 
 When it's true love you held dear 
 Feel it rising 
 So cut me to size, I'm losing shape through all this 
 You call me sublime 
 You know that's such a waste of energy 
 Will I change your mind if I could show you my way? 
 A black stain on your heart 
 You know that's not what I wanna see 
 You'll bury this, slow down 
 It's time to make amends (always in vain now)

You relate through the bloodline 
 When you can never take anything that I give 
 Always wanting to relate through me 
 I go, watch you slowly slip away 
 You're wanting to put your trust in 
 When I can feel this remedy kickin' on 
 Just to taste it, just to want it 
 And I can say it's not my fault 
 Say it's all right 
 When I'm coming down 
 Not again, it's so lifelike 
 Come make it all right 
 When I'm coming down 
 Not again, I'm fragile 
 Would you choose me or just abuse me?

 You see, I'll be the one in your darkest time... 
 (It's not my fault!) 
 Should I begin to erase myself? 
 I'm caught in this picture of you 
 Should I begin to assess myself? 
 Tell me it's over... 
 It comes from above with these feelings 
 It takes you away and it buries your soul again 
 You're now blessed by ignorance 
 'Cause you want to 
 So run with me if you must follow 
 I'll take you away to this place where we can be free 
 A place I call ecstasy 
 Now you lie alone 
 Your chance to stop and stare 
 God, I kiss your bones... 
 And say it's not my fault

I'm touching you and tearing back 
 And dreaming of your life 
 I wanted to be hurting 
 Shallow eyes 
 Not to mention I'm falling, dreaming 
 What is wrong with silencing my thoughts? 
 You were there, 
 And you weren't designed for what they're selling 
 Slow down, take time, let it heal 
 Hide your face from mine 
 I'd follow you entwined 
 My bleeding eyes are sewn blind 
 Fade away, if you reach this in two minds 
 Not to mention I'm dreaming, falling short 
 Sell me away that this is real 
 Saving me, settle down, and I will fall upon thee 
 In this happiness I'm so damn lonely 
 Slow down, take time, let it heal 
 Hide your face from mine 
 Slow down, take time, let it heal 
 Hide your face from mine 
 It's too late to find, body and mind, 
 Another reason holds you there, 
 Spit it out, cause I feel this love has gone astray 
 Darling you'll have to promise me that you won't turn 
 around 
 Just as well I'm burning down 
 You take me away.

Run within us, run with spite 
 Set your eyes upon it 
 With you agrieved, I see through your eyes, I need 
 I will not be the fallen 
 From this moses basket 
 I should have felt something 
 I should have done something, after I fall 
 Will you be there? 
 Run within us, run with sight 
 Set your eyes upon it 
 So breathe in silently, fade all colour from my skin 
 To reflect from within 
 From this moses basket 
 I should have felt something 
 I should have done something, after I fall 
 Will you be there? 
 Shall I free it 
 Shall I be it? 
 Sometimes I miss you 
 I feel it 
 Reflect from within 
 So come down, breathe in, die slow 
 I should have felt something in my own mind 
 I should have felt something 
 So come down, see them die slow 
 In the end it will surely break you 
 Show me power and I'll show you being 
 In the end it all amounts to nothing 
 Helpless it's coming on

 The glass that breaks against the wall

 You're free to go 
 You're free to go 
 I will fight 'til there's nothing left 
 Watch the world together from this sinking ship 
 Or drown alone 
 Here 
 Off the coast, facing nothingness 
 Drawn to feel the emptiness 
 Oh, help me now

I'm onto you 
 I've seen your ways 
 Show yourself 
 Better the ones you make believe 
 All I hear 
 Is the sound of sleep 
 Deafening 
 Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams 
 Now, this won't take long 
 We'll rise up again 
 And rewrite these wrongs 
 I won't do it 
 I've rushed you 
 Patiently 
 Guarding the life that you deceived 
 I've crawled for you 
 Or so they say 
 We rise to it 
 Fall again into the same dream 
 You won't have to wait long 
 They'll show up again 
 Make way for the fall 
 Wake up 
 There's blood in your sweat when you wake up 
 Cower, bloodsucking liar 
 Who you gonna call when you wake up? 
 See now 
 What you gonna see when you wake up? 
 Beg, you little fucking liar 
 Your head on this chopping board 
 If this is entertaining 
 I hope you all enjoy the view 
 Wide awake 
 But still asleep 
 I'm failing this riddle in my head, I 
 I'm failing to get it 
 Can you say? 
 Honestly? 
 Wide awake 
 But still asleep 
 Don't leave this too long 
 (It won't take long) 
 Tomorrow will come 
 (Hang around) 
 You won't have to wait long 
 (We'll rise up again) 
 It's your day in the sun 
 They've shown up again 
 They've shown up again 
 They've shown up again 
 They've shown up again 
 Please wake up 
 Please wake up

How did they find me? 
 How did they know? 
 This misconception of fate 
 I'm about to let go 
 Awake in a new light 
 I'm alone in this room 
 Heavy at heart, it may be a lie 
 You will not see me 
 It's a new day 
 (Why did they follow me home) 
 It's a new day 
 One more step 
 It's here waiting for you 
 Now go slow, take your time 
 Leave no mark 
 You lost your way 
 I hope you're watching me 
 One more step 
 It's here waiting for you 
 Now go slow take your time 
 Subtle breakdown for the one so free 
 You lost your way 
 No one held you back from me 
 How do you all speak 
 With a lying tongue? 
 How do we all sleep 
 With a dying sun? 
 Sit down lighten your load 
 This storm is coming 
 You should stay home 
 But I feel warm 
 Hey let's get lost in the crowd 
 While searching for something worth holding 
 Hey let's get 
 Still lost in the crowd 
 I'll show you so much more 
 Much more, so much more 
 So much more 
 Are we waiting? For the savior? 
 Someone to heal this or erase us 
 How did they find me? 
 How did they know? 
 This misconception of fate 
 I'm about to let go 
 Awake in a new light

########### Set Fire To The Hive ###########
I don't know what's wrong but I'm on fire 
 It sears through my hands, leaving skin on the wire 
 Awake in this womb with a crown sting in my self 
 When I listen, the same cry plays on 
 We're slaves 
 In this medicated cage 
 Make a decision to face this - change 
 The rules, they don't explain 
 So why do we obey? 
 Politics, religion, your vision's the same 
 You played us, as both a cancer and a cure 
 Which reminds me that it's just a game 
 Your alibi - a sales pitch 
 Your pretty boy, pretty face dolled up again 
 A star for us to adore 
 And you, man, you've got to be more 
 'Cause this affects all 
 It's nice to know you're with us today 
 I've seen you in the fog along the way 
 I'll spit in the mouth of your god 
 Who whispers in the minds of our children 
 You've been sold again 
 Set fire to the hive as you flee 
 It's fiction, a faceless illusion 
 You've been had again 
 You swing this wrecking ball 
 A violent (howling???) pendulum 
 To hypnotise them all 
 The writing on the wall 
 That we keep missing 
 A structure built to fall 
 Still we all obey 
 It's nice to know you're with us today 
 I've seen you in the fog along the way 
 I'll spit in the mouth of your god 
 Who whispers in the minds of our children 
 You've been sold again

 You've been had again

Paint 
 Me in your own way 
 Color my eyes 
 See what feelings I hide 
 No-one knows why 
 No one can forgive 
 Second thought 
 Why do I care? 
 I'll hide from subtleties while 
 I try to face my kind 
 And you call this feeling 
 It's not enough 
 Come again another day 
 Now that my world feels out of place 
 I'll follow you home 
 Wake me with a bottle 'cross the head 
 I'll sleep 'til it's over and I'm sober again 
 Safe 
 Well I don't feel so safe here 
 Imagine that everything's affected by a cause 
 In this game you call luck 
 (There's nowhere to go) 
 Well I don't feel so lucky, no 
 (Lie to yourself) 
 And just when I think I've worked it out 
 These pieces move and I'm back to the start 
 Wake me with a bottle 'cross the head 
 I'll sleep 'til it's over and I'm sober again 
 Hey 
 It's nothing that you'd understand 
 I promised you maybe 
 Always 
 Do you think it matters? 
 (Here I will stand) 
 Do you think at all? 
 (Here I will fall) 
 Are we complicated? 
 (Organized recovery) 
 Or do we know it all? 
 (I'll always go) 
 I don't want to 
 (Here I will stand) 
 I just have to 
 (Here I will fall) 
 I don't need it 
 (Organized recovery) 
 I just want it 
 (I'll always go) 
 And lay this troubled sinner 
 With a gun in your hand 
 Now you live for no-one 
 Knowing what you held in your own 
 Wasted moment 
 Set in stone and blood 
 Hold your promise 
 Save your cheap remarks, just leave me here alone

 We just severed these umbilical wires 
 This is more than just affinity 
 We're moving further through an endless desire

 This is the sound 
 Of your reason to wake 
 Have we forgotten now? 
 Can we relate? 
 It's backwards, it makes no sense

 It's harder to just pretend

 Try a little see if I could make the moment last 
 You'll burn you'll light up like a star 
 You'll break this heart you hold 
 When you're coming 'round, you're 
 Taken by wonder of it all

 You better pull yourself along 
 Time is precious and you must act 
 This isn't inevitable 
 I still stand 
 I won't get back in my cell 
 I will not let a saviour define my freedom 
 I'm going out now 
 No-one is gonna save us from this 
 We should have known better not to taste this wine we swallow 
 For all and more, we set our recourse for tomorrow 
 Now we could mend, we will awake this snake and follow 
 Shatter the hourglass and what do you see 
 Memories like grains of sand are blowing away 
 Is this who you are? A product of fear 
 The shell of a man who lost his innocence 
 Hold your nerve 
 Keep your focus 
 There's something peculiar about the way you pay to save your soul 
 You forfeit your dream 
 Just let it go 
 We should have known better not to drink this wine we swallow 
 For all and more, we set our recourse for tomorrow 
 Now here we stand, we will embrace it or be defiant 
 For the moment, taken by these chemicals you can't control 
 Ask the question

 Don't even hear a sound they make, it breaks you

 Words that taunt you when you listen

 Words that haunt you while you're sleeping 
 You seem afraid, don't be alarmed 
 It's only the face of things to come 
 Servant to the sun, we are beings, we become as one 
 Lighting every cell, every shape we will never form 
 And is it relevant? 
 Our fears, our faults 
 As foolish as it sounds 
 So lead us on (Only one way left)

 Changing the weather 
 I feel it at first 
 Blow from the dark 
 Take it for better 
 Still I remind myself 
 How I define myself 
 Black of the bruise 
 Coming up clear 
 Bound to get better 
 Bless with a curse 
 Hoping I fall 
 Deeper the better 
 I needed 
 I needed to know 
 I needed 
 I needed to know why 
 Oh no, this can't be happening 
 Oh no, this can't be happening

 A fever burning for more 
 A red light in my mind that I feed on 
 You must've been so surprised to see 
 There you were starting back at me 
 Caught in a web now 
 Out on your own 
 You've got nothing to stay for 
 So you keep saying 
 This year it's coming 
 And guess what we're running from 
 Too late for running 
 The stitches are coming undone 
 Grab your belongings 
 The exit is near 
 Making your way through indecisiveness 
 I needed 
 I needed to know 
 I needed 
 I needed to know why 
 Oh no, this can't be happening 
 Oh no, this can't be happening 
 This man is methodised 
 You're colourblind in this madness 
 I'll bide all of my time for your love 
 Oh crooked man you'll die 
 Like excuses pouring out a child 
 Sing S.O.S. you saint 
 I'll make room for laughter 
 It all ends right here 
 This water's dark and cold 
 God's not where you hoped 
 His moment come and gone 
 It's too late, mayday 
 Call out mayday 
 While I'm still alive 
 Hey no matter 
 I don't want this to end, 
 I don't want this to end, 
 I don't want this to end, 
 I don't think this will end well 
 Hey, there goes my love again 
 No one's coming now 
 Hey, I'm out on my own again 
 Fading faces, broken frowns 
 Hey, I guess I fucked up again 
 No one will find out 
 Hey, stare at your feet again 
 Don't say you don't know 
 This water's dark and cold 
 God's not where you hoped 
 His moment come and gone 
 It's time we all moved on 
 It's time we all moved on 
 It's time we all moved on 
 Away 
 Still I remind myself 
 How I define myself 
 Still I remind myself 
 (I needed to know) 
 How I define myself 
 (I needed to know) 
 I needed to know 
 I needed to know 
 I needed to know 
 - Change (Part 1) - 
 So if you like the sound of 
 The glass that breaks against the wall 
 I'd trade it all for several 
 Pieces of your anger 
 I am the interest of your heart 
 Say: "This would wash away" 
 I'm climbing this rope, I feel God 
 Would I care to stare you down? 
 I portray you in different light

Hello 
 Hollow halo 
 Hello 
 (Can you hear them say?) 
 Hollow halo 
 (Can you hear them calling?) 
 You'll never 
 You'll never leave this world alone 
 You'll never 
 You'll never leave this world alone 
 And I become a martyr to the stars 
 Become a model to the same 
 Side that I've been fighting, I'm 
 Still afraid to crawl 
 (No more pointing fingers at mistakes and I'm) 
 And though I know I'm not the same 
 (Here in our reflection) 
 I'm still afraid to watch 
 How do you suppose, 
 We can light the way to get us home? 
 What you thought was lost, now found within 
 Feel this weight lift 
 No more pointing fingers at mistakes, and I'm 
 Here in our reflection 
 What a way to see this thing out 
 What a way to lay this burden down 
 What a way to see this sorrow 
 What a way to see this one out 
 Hello, hollow halo 
 Hello, hollow halo 
 Hello, hollow halo 
 Hello, hollow halo 
 All this leads to nothing 
 Still this world won't wait 
 Complicated nothings 
 Still this world won't wait 
 What a way to see this thing out 
 What a way to lay your burden down 
 What a way to see no tragedy 
 Hello, hollow halo 
 Hello, hollow halo 
 Hello, hollow halo 
 (Can you hear them say?) 
 Hello, hollow halo 
 (Can you hear them calling?) 
 (Can you hear them calling?) 
 "You can see all of this 
 And watch it before your eyes 
 And everything owes its existence 
 Solely and completely to sound 
 Sound is a factor of which holds it together 
 Sound is the basis of form and shape 
 Put that into the modern idiom 
 And say into the great voids of space 
 Came a sound, and matter took shape 
 Please watch carefully" 
 Sine waves and mirrors 
 The smoke that you inhale 
 Dry mouthing bitter tones 
 Better left unsaid 
 I know this will burn you 
 So I become the fire, these days will change us all 
 Don't you feel the same? 
 Don't we fear the same things? 
 Don't we feel the same? 
 Don't you fear at all? 
 Lay here 
 Maybe the damage has been done 
 As we float away like embers 
 Beneath us, the fire, still it burns 
 And I don't, I don't know why 
 We question who we are and then we die 
 I guess, I'll see you when it ends 
 I'll see you 'round the bend 
 My sober sorry friend 
 Don't you feel the same? 
 Don't we feel the same? 
 I'll see you when it ends 
 I'll see you 'round the bend 
 Don't you feel the same? 
 My sober sorry friend 
 When we collide 
 Some say goodbye 
 Some save their words 
 Leaving no resolve 
 There's a break in the wall 
 You can feel it 
 It's letting us all escape 
 So, people, tell me you need 
 The waking day 
 To fall asleep 
 Light your way 
 Find your place 
 In this
########### Nachash ###########
Subtle waves in motion 
 Shaping spirals are underground 
 Where it lies it goes 
 Stuck in weak old forms 
 Here we go our minds recall 
 Out of control in this spinning wheel 
 Starting to face what we feed and what we can't ignore 
 Starting to swell 
 this is bigger than you 
 Though it could be something beautiful 
 It's beginning to feel like we're part of something real 
 When I shift 
 to signal that some days it's 
 Phoenix come fracture my sleep 
 Now this shaking sky 
 needs a show to start in 
 We wait to carry away 
 On the promises 
 I fear it taking over 
 and I fear taking over 
 I'm feeling opaque as our colours all fade to grey 
 here in the light of my darkest day 
 Its silent 
 I settle my thoughts so maybe 
 I can relax into my sigh 
 My minds always window shopping 
 but I can't afford the payment 
 I feell like I've wasted my last chance 
 to try 
 Wait 
 I'm here in this moment 
 A pivotal moment 
 Its taken me over 
 It's starting to swell 
 This is bigger than you 
 Though it could be something beautiful 
 Its beginning to feel like we're part of something real
########### A.M. War ###########
If we live to see another year 
 Well it didn't make much room for it 
 So they say 
 No, it wouldn't change a single thing 
 We live every other day like every other day 
 And I said 
 Can I be honest? 
 Will I be here to stay? 
 But we can't despair with our heads in your hands 
 We might as well walk away 
 Another! 
 Put another blot of color on the scenery 
 'Cause you're no visionary 
 Just a blot on the scenery 
 You're my design 
 All things aside 
 We're almost out of time 
 One more day to see through 
 Now we've learned that things are not okay 
 We will all say goodbye 
 We're almost out of time 
 In this hopeless cold divide 
 Something new this time 
 And I swear it's under my skin 
 I've gotta get out of the way (x5) 
 (Don't want you to stay!) 
 Another! 
 Put another blot of color on the scenery 
 You're no visionary 
 Just a blot on the scenery 
 You're my design 
 And if it matters to you, 
 Don't waste time 
 Just be ready 
 'Cause we're leaving you with nothing 
 If it matters to you 
 Make your peace or drown in decay 
 We've gotta get out of the way (x3)
########### We Are ###########
I know there's something wrong 
 Stop making it up 
 We're too proud to see we've lost more than our trust 
 And now there's nothing left 
 Well's dead and dried up 
 This disease has left a foul taste in our cup 
 It just keeps on flowing 
 And we drift unknowing 
 It just keeps on flowing 
 This babble from our mouth 
 Who we are, I fear most of the time 
 Carry on shuffling 
 In order and in line 
 Who we are, I feel most of the time 
 Carry on whipping boy 
 Stare into the light 
 Stare into the light 
 And it feels familiar for good reason 
 I want us to break the case we're in 
 We've worn it for too long, this catatonic skin 
 To move all the parts 
 I want us to face the shape we're in 
 A world of confusion awaits our sons and kin 
 Let's reset it all 
 Let's reset it all 
 Well it stings, it hurts, is this how it's meant to be? 
 Well it stings and it hurts, is this how it's meant to be? 
 Well it stings 
 It hurts 
 A small price to pay to be in control 
 And rebirth what our future's meant to be 
 Who we are, I fear most of the time 
 So carry on whipping boy 
 Stare into the light 
 I want us to face the shape we're in 
 A world of confusion awaits our sons and kin 
 Let's reset it all 
 Let's reset it all

 These words of wisdom 
 Come with lack of vision 
 This is the worst day I've ever 
 Had to stand and witness

 WE ARE A BROKEN WRECK 
 WE'VE BOTH GOT PILES OF REGRETS 
 There ain't nothin' you can say or prove 
 I held the rope that let you down 
 As we crash into the waves and drown 
 This is impossible 
 So if there's any doubt 
 I will throw you a line 
 Excuses, excuses 
 Don't ever remind me 
 How it is and always will be 
 WE ARE A BROKEN WRECK 
 WE'VE BOTH GOT PILES OF REGRETS 
 There ain't nothin' you can say or prove 
 That I held the rope that let you down 
 As we crash into the waves and drown 
 This is impossible 
 You've been this way before 
 Shadows here all know you 
 I don't know what you've heard 
 Or what it is inside you 
 We are all around you 
 We are all around you 
 We are all around you 
 If love comes first 
 Maybe our lives will dissolve 
 Young fruit, still not bruised 
 Hey, maybe, just maybe, 
 We all made our moves 
 And mine could've helped you

I think there's a pulse, 
 But I don't remember feeling 
 Anything close to this, 
 And I don't know if it's worthwhile. 
 But I hope so, 
 'Cause I don't feel so well 
 I don't feel so well 
 I've got to keep a grip on this, 
 Or the rising tide could still 
 Pull us underneath 
 And leave us to the ocean. 
 Either way, 
 I'm starting to feel that something's wrong 
 With this poison 
 'Cause in my veins it's burning. 
 And I hope you hold a place for us, 
 Far enough away, 
 From all the flames they like to tell us about. 
 And I hope you hold a way for us, 
 'Cause I don't really know you 
 I don't really know you 
 Why the hell did I seek the truth? 
 All I've seen in its reflection 
 Still part of me regrets it. 
 And I just wanted to see (the truth). 
 Now it's clear, 
 We're alone in this. 
 It's your funeral; 
 It's your dying day. 
 So make amends, 
 Before the end 
 Will leave us nothing. 
 It's your funeral; 
 It's your dying day. 
 So make amends, 
 For one last stand, 
 Then leave with nothing. 
 When I breathe again? 
 Will my lungs fill with fire? 
 When I breathe again, 
 I hope it's okay. 
 When I see again? 
 When the smoke clears, 
 Who will still remain here? 
 When I see again, 
 I hope it's okay.

I couldn't hide my face to claim my innocence; 
 I wouldn't have the sense to keep going on. 
 Maybe I'm just too proud to stand in your defense? 
 Still I feel the pull of hidden wires. 
 I'm never gonna try, I lie, 
 I dared to speak my mind, 
 When all the old changes made before 
 Don't seem to change a thing at all. 
 Are you real? 
 Are you real? 
 I wouldn't find my place with this poor disguise. 
 Why can't I face myself without these lies? 
 I couldn't find my path without knowing it. 
 I've been around every turn; I know what's left is right. 
 I never let it die, I tried, 
 I dared to free my mind. 
 And all the same changes as before 
 Don't seem to change a thing at all. 
 I'm never gonna try, I know 
 That I won't go back. 
 It started with a smile, I know, 
 But it won't come back. 
 This is real. 
 Should've seen it coming, 
 'Cause now I'm feeling nothing 
 Always taking me far beneath the middle. 
 Should've seen it coming,

 So out of touch, so out of mind 
 I can feel you there I won’t lie 
 We’re all just kids we’re all good liars 
 Good liars 
 Please try to understand there is no great plan 
 We have no idea what lies beyond our reach 
 Try to understand there is no great plan 
 We will cross the line with an open mind 
 Show me what it is 
 Hush my desires

 Please try to understand there is no great plan

 Try to understand with another plan 
 We have crossed the line with an open mind 
 We have crossed the line

 You’re new to me and I believe 
 You have to be the one we need 
 Soon you will see it with all 
 Our reasons for trying are justified 
 We know the fate of the world 
 The dearly departed they won’t make a sound 
 They won’t make a sound 
 You are the same as the salt blood running in our veins 
 Few have the heart of the brave now, will you run or stay? 
 We hide away our vicious things don’t let them out 
 Even the ones that we don’t see who are always there 
 You are the salt of all 
 You are the salt of same blood running in our veins 
 Few have the heart of the brave now, will you run or stay? 
 We hide away our vicious things don’t let them out 
 Even the ones that we don’t see who are always there 
 You’re new to me and I believe 
 You have to be the one we need 
 Take me with you on your sky machine

 I'm dying to know 
 (We have cast our lies to the open skies) 
 Way out far from what it is we see 
 (Try to understand, we've another plan

Some of you will get out alive 
 Though you'll bear all the cost 
 I promised you all your scars 
 Will be worth all you've lost 
 We've taken the fall 
 To save your skin 
 We've stomached them all 
 These precious medicines 
 Sick as we are... 
 We are strong 
 Now freedom comes when this anthem is sung 
 And the fates come undone 
 'Cause we have switched the lights on 
 We've exposed their friend-in-arms 
 Now we stand as one at the end 
 If we are the last few, 
 Who will be the first one to lead us? 
 If we are the last few 
 You lie here alive (?) 
 One chance to prove this so fiercely comitted 
 To new life, new life! 
 We're alone and comitted 
 New life, new life! 
 New life, new life! 
 If we are the last few, 
 Now we're alone and comitted 
 We are the last few

 To give us the feeling like 
 We won't allow it 
 Forever 
 And ever 
 Forever will they know this light 
 Cornered enough to make a sound 
 Hear it everlasting 
 We refrain they're not allowed to 
 Have enough 
 Just enough to get by 
 The freedoms 
 We're ever chasing 
 Just when the feeling strikes 
 We're not around it 
 Cornered enough to make a sound

 They'll refrain they sing aloud to 
 Just enough to get by 
 Just enough to get by 
 Just enough to get by

"What do you think of it? 
 To do this in two minutes, eternity in an hour. 
 It's almost impossible, of course, to describe it. 
 You can only say: It isn't, it isn't. 
 Trying to tell people what it is. 
 Well of course, I don't know any of our friends which haven't said 
 this one thing in common. 
 Well, I never knew anything like this in the whole of my life. 
 And one or two people have said to me, I've said it to myself. 
 That's what death is going to be like, and oh what fun it would be! 
 How do you mean that? 
 Well i mean that there are the colours, the beauties, the designs, 
 the beautiful ways which things appear. 
 People themselves, common people, appear fascinating, 
 intressing, mysterious, wonderful. 
 But death's only the beginning. 
 Suddenly you notice there aren't these separations. 
 That we're not on a seperate island shouting across to somebody 
 else and trying to hear what they're saying, and misunderstanding. 
 You know, you use the word yourself. 
 Empathy. 
 This thing's flowing underneath, we're parts of a single constant, 
 it meets underneath the rock. 
 And with that goes such delight, a sober certainty of wainting bliss."

 Lead myself back to my coma shell 
 No better face left to bare 
 I see more than you 
 And I feel more than you 
 You're spinning me out 
 It's a better room now, it's a better place 
 I would beg you to scream at me 
 The voices cry, the fashion mold 
 They want the truth, not what it seems 
 Bust myself back into pieces 
 I pull at the seam as you start to tear 
 Lead myself back to my coma shell

It takes some time to learn your lies 
 Shut your gates forever, guard your walls 
 Run quick your enemy pursues behind you 
 Lost buried in envy and deceit 
 So you stand and so shall you fall 
 Lying in your blood 
 Death for defeat 
 Spoils to the victor 
 Misery and pain for those left standing 
 Watch your city burn and your enemies triumph over you 
 The angel of death passes before your throne
########### Return To Reality ###########
Brothers and sisters take a look around at this polluted perverse world we live in 
 What is the latest fashion? What's the latest trend? 
 On your list of priorities these shouldn't even make the top ten 
 So what's going to be next? I think we all just need to take a step back 
 Take a step back take a look to see what's really going on 
 What we can do to get the fallen on their feet 
 This is the death of the flesh 
 Lets end the separation 
 With all the love in our hearts 
 Today we stand united 
 Just when you thought you had it all together 
 Someone came behind you and pulled the rug from under your feet 
 How does that make you feel? 
 How could their impudence make you want to turn the other cheek 
 What's done is done just set it aside turn from their ways take back your life 
 Animosity has crowded the streets we walk 
 Deception has poisoned the air we breathe 
 Return to reality this is no longer your carefree fantasy 
 Lift up your heads O ye gates so we can see
########### Turn It All Around ###########
Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around 
 We live our lives hoping that in the end everything will fix itself 
 Find the truth in the words that you speak and the things that you do 
 Do what it takes to change at any cost 
 Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around 
 The reward will be greater than the sacrifice when its all said and done 
 Reach out your hand to someone, and make a difference 
 Your flesh must be willing to die, willing to die 
 BUILD YOUR WALLS, TEAR THEM DOWN, AND OPEN YOUR HEART!
########### Vanquished ###########
Vanquished at the hands of the master 
 Taken and destroyed 
 Broken is your sense of salvation 
 Waiting on the line 
 Lifeless is your mindless perception 
 Open up your eyes 
 This life that you lead is nothing 
 This animation a broken design open your eyes 
 This life is broken inside you've met your demise 
 There is nothing left to give, give your life away 
 Broken salvation, broken inside 
 This life stained with hate open up your eyes 
 Can you find a reason to live this life? 
 To live without it you will die 
 Screaming opened eyed will you live this lie 
 Screaming for your attention to see me waiting on the line

Something from nothing 
 Gold from stone 
 Turn the key and open the box of secrets 
 Inside are the answers to life's tormenting questions 
 What one would give to gain 
 The knowledge the world seeks to find 
 The ends of the earth cannot hold all its power 
 Forged in the darkness before there was light 
 Look to the skies 
 It rolls on the thunder it dances with lightning 
 It rides on the wind and flows with the tide 
 The mysteries of life have never been found 
 But I've opened the box and I've seen whats inside 
 Only one knows the answers and it is I

Come one come all this is the truth or so they say 
 The image is more important than, it's more important than the being 
 The truth is this message is a dissimulated depiction of what is reality 
 They have become a wounder, a wounder of the healers 
 Rather than a healer of the many wounded 
 Come one come all this is the truth not what they say 
 Without grace how can any of us make any progress 
 We all have sinned and fallen short 
 But if we let that hold us back we would be nothing at all 
 Personal responsibility has replaced personal response 
 This is the final straw 
 You are dead to me 
 Your actions prove nothing 
 You are dead to us

 What will you take from this what will you make of this 
 There is a season for everything 
 What will you take from this what will you make

 That moment 
 when you stepped in 
 The encounter the day 
 I turned and ran to you 
 Your thoughts are not like mine 
 Your ways extend 
 outside the lines of space and time 
 redirect my steps towards your light 
 I will give thanks 
 through my walk 
 and through my faith 
 My life is Yours, you set the pace 
 You are worthy of all my praise

 Caught up in a frenzy like rats crawling on there belly 
 Staying low to the ground to escape the hundred-million K 
 Reasoning technology has never soothed the taste of ease 
 That's running from our lips to blind us in our greedy eyes 
 Force us to pave the blind shroud of hell.

 Led to the firmament silently 
 Face the crying whore tomorrow she will die in court blind 
 Blind pale eyes fixed on dead clocks to kill the time blind 
 Low voices 
 Secret unsung - the song records the voice closed 
 Opened doors of the dying source 
 The point guides off to wait and suffer but they dance the blinded 
 Judgment seeks their name with hurried vengeance for their life of silence

 Orphan the plus from the minus

 Psychopathic slut shuts the mouth sewn shut 
 About to turn dead 
 Temper the burn

 Pay the parting cost 
 Burn slow 
 All will stand cheering for their own death 
 Turn around face the crowd 
 Checking out the final taste you will have in the time that you waste in the firmament

 Let them all run, run away from you 
 There is lightning in this room 
 Above our heads, waiting to strike 
 I'm a thinker not a talker 
 Put your faith, your faith in God 
 We were hoping for some romance 
 All we found was more despair 
 We must talk about our problems 
 We are in a state of flux 
 I'd kill for an adventure 
 Just you and I, in the Curzon Bar 
 Dancing till we knew 
 So all that we've learnt disappears 
 When you shouted at me 
 I saw my father in the second grade 
 Concerned and kind 
 Yet unable to reach me 
 We were hoping for some romance 
 All we found was more despair 
 We must talk about our problems 
 We are in a state of flux 
 State of flux (9 TIMES) 
 We need to talk (5 TIMES) 
 We were hoping for some romance 
 All we found was more despair 
 We must talk about our problems 
 We are in a state of flux

 This is treacherous 
 This is cold hearted betrayal 
 Move in for the kill 
 And you're all traitors

 Burn down the houses 
 Loot all the churches 
 And we found the time to pray 
 Pray that our justice be done 
 Pray by the light of the moon 
 That we're not here
########### You Don't Walk Away From Dismemberment ###########
I will spill blood 
 On your filthy princess whites 
 Come home tonight 
 So I can slit your throat 
 Every time you discard my heart 
 Your ships sinking fast 
 The colours are fading 
 Save me again tonight, you know I'll make it count 
 Princess, there's more to life than robbing banks 
 You won't walk away from this broken heart 
 Slash my arms 
 Tear off my limbs 
 I will never back down to your sin.

Been searching all day

 Do you remember when 
 Life was so simple? 
 They were shooting at us 
 After all this time 
 Shooting at us 
 Killing us all 
 And we're all numb 
 Numb with the sound 
 Sound of our fears 
 We're all numb 
 And just before you die 
 Take a look up at the sky 
 Tell them it was all worth it
########### They'll Be Hanging Us Tonight ###########
Raid all the liquour stores 
 Kidnap the kids 
 This night's not over yet 
 Running on Lucifer's blood 
 We're trashed in the back of your car 
 A cheap lay in the parking lot 
 A shot for afters 
 As I watched you slaying behind the wheel 
 They're gaining on us 
 A sharp turn left 
 Running out of time 
 They're gaining on us 
 The lights flashed by as we sped towards our escape 
 Nothing else mattered 
 Nobody else cared 
 They'll be hanging us tonight 
 This was our masterpiece
########### This Confession Means Nothing ###########
I close my eyes 
 And hold you in my arms 
 Despite all the pain 
 Your confession means nothing
########### A Portrait For The Deceased ###########
We are both silenced 
 And we're sure this does not add up 
 Still we try and place our bets 
 We're sure this does not add up 
 Still we're dying 
 To make that call 
 Our people versus yours 
 Never did make sense 
 Your people versus mine 
 Light me up it's all too much for me 
 Never did make sense, come dance with me 
 We'll go out the sea, the sky was blood read 
 Images of people dead 
 Stained with the shadows 
 Of our past victims, we're out at sea 
 Then come and drown with me 
 We'll float away, drift away 
 Our corpses lifeless 
 Then somehow tell me we made sense
########### In The Desert ###########
We'll fight this cause 
 Even if it kills us 
 The temperature is rising 
 But our lungs will not collapse 
 Here in the desert 
 There's nothing to run from 
 Nothing to hide from 
 So lets rock the casbah 
 Take it by the scruff of the neck 
 And if you've got the time, baby I've got the money 
 And I'd give anything to see her smile again 
 And I'd do anything for one last smile 
 She had a love like nobody else 
 Unrivalled beauty wanted them to love her back 
 When they didn't she shed a tear 
 A piece of us all died that day 
 We all died that day
########### The Darkest Tomb ###########
It's getting hard to breathe in here 
 What I would give to be set free 
 This darkness surrounding me 
 They're coming for us 
 They're closing in 
 Take careful aim 
 I know you won't miss 
 Avoid eye contact 
 Shoot the messenger 
 Pools of blood surround 
 Don't run and hide this time 
 But we've made a mistake 
 A glaring error 
 We're adrift 
 Nearly gone 
 And if you knew 
 You'd get away with it all what would you do? 
 In my darkened tomb, I am laid to waste
########### Buried At Sea ###########
Send my regards to you and yours 
 I'm not coming back for you 
 And I'll hold onto the last memory of you 
 I'll hold onto you and bury you at sea 
 How can you watch me split in two? 
 You've done this before, you know me oh too well 
 Send my regards to you and yours 
 And no hope will come from this 
 So turn around and run 
 How can you smile when you see me crumbling? 
 And we all stood back and watched the waves crash down on you 
 Send my regards to you and yours 
 And there's no hope for someone as cold as you 
 You made me sink into the coldest of waves 
 I watch you sink into lies that you created
########### Hunt Them Down ###########
Yeah! 
 Hunt them down before it's too late 
 Now is the time to make the most of their pain 
 They deserve it for all that they have ruined for you 
 Don't think or say anything 
 Don't hold back, 
 You'll regret this night. x2 
 It's all over, yeah! 
 Don't make the same mistake twice 
 Finish them now 
 Push them down 
 Face first to the ground 
 They deserve it for all they have done to you. 
 Make the most of their pain 
 They deserve it for... ruined you 
 Now is the time to make the most of their pain 
 Hunt them down before it's too late 
 Don't think or say anything, not now.
########### You'll Find Safety ###########
Go! 
 Find comfort in yourself 
 Begin to believe, before it's over 
 Lift your head up 
 Everybody's talking 
 Prove them wrong 
 Before your time is up 
 You keep it all in, and you never find a release 
 Take comfort in yourself 
 And only know how to find safety in yourself 
 Find your faith and find your hope 
 You'll find safety 
 I know it's hard to look up when everything's falling down on you 
 It's hard, but you can make it 
 Begin to believe 
 I know it's hard to look up when everything's falling down.
########### Always ###########
If only you were here to hold my head above bloody waters 
 We could make it through 
 You turned your back on me and now I do the same to you 
 You made me feel so hollow 
 How can the man that you looked up to turn around and say three words that hurt more than you'll ever know 
 You don't know what it feels like to be in my shoes 
 You turned your back on me as I stood there and fell to the floor 
 This time there's no reason for me to turn around and scream for help 
 But if only you were here to hold my head above all those things you said to tie me down 
 I'm looking for forgiveness for something that I didn't even do 
 How can you call yourself and idol, a person to trust? 
 How can I look so high up when you're always holding me down?
########### Heartless ###########
How can you stand there and look me in the eye? 
 Tell me that you knew it was coming for us 
 I know that you said I was all you ever wanted 
 But you pushed me overboard 
 Into knee deep water 
 And you didn't throw the anchor of hope 
 You pushed me overboard 
 Without concern for what I was feeling inside 
 Heartless intentions 
 Your favorite game to play 
 I knew that I was never good enough to make you smile 
 Still you play these games, you ruin me from the inside 
 Tearing me down 
 I can't hide 
 I can't not act torn about this 
 What can I do to make you see? 
 How it affects me, so deeply still 
 I'm untouched from your point of view
########### North Lane ###########
I don't feel homesick, I'm just so sick of home 
 It's here that reminds me of everything we've been through 
 And it tears me down 
 It makes me sick of being who I am, of who I cannot be 
 A constant reminder 
 I don't feel homesick, I'm just so sick of home 
 It's here that reminds me of everything we've been through 
 Cold nights, again left alone 
 Wandering streets all on my own 
 And all of this for you 
 It's time that I went back for just even an hour 
 To talk to you to make things fine again 
 Again and again I will run from you.
########### I Can't See The Light ###########
For weeks I've felt lost and I can't see the light 
 Shining through the darkest of days 
 What can I do to stop myself from hiding my thoughts 
 From this world of lies? 
 I've felt so lost for far too long 
 Trying to leave it all behind 
 I find I cannot forgive myself for feeling like this 
 How can I even begin to forgive myself for all the things I'm thinking of doing to you? 
 How can I forgive myself for this? 
 But it's all in your head 
 You just walk out of my life and you expect me to let you back in 
 With open arms I'll turn to you 
 For weeks I've felt lost and I can't see the light 
 So I'll do this one alone 
 I'll hide my thoughts from you 
 Is it beyond impossible for me to hold on for you? 
 Is it beyond you to forgive me? 
 If not I'll do it on my own time 
 How can I forgive myself? 
 For my world is slowly falling down 
 And you just stand there and watch me fall
########### Low ###########
I can't see myself holding on for much longer, x2 
 It's tearing me apart 
 I feel so out of place from the rest of you 
 All I needed was something 
 And that something was you 
 But you're so far away now, 
 Can you hear me screaming? x4
########### Running From The Sun ###########
The sun was so low that day 
 Staring into burning eyes 
 Watch as I walk away from you 
 From the lies that you made my life 
 Making me feel so lost and helpless 
 Running won't help me 
 Now it's too late 
 Closing my eyes to the skies makes it worse 
 Look down and I've been here for far too long 
 Too long to contemplate 
 The was so low that day 
 Staring into burning eyes 
 But it's far too late to contemplate leaving you alone against your will 
 Running won't help you now 
 Look down and try to forget me 
 Staring into your burning eyes 
 All that is left is the sound of your fragile voice 
 Echoing in my wondering mind 
 The sun was so low that day 
 I had to turn from your gaze 
 Only to reassure 
 Running won't help
########### Save Me ###########
I won't hold my hand out to anyone but you 
 I don't want to trust anyone but you 
 If I am to be saved my anybody I want it to be you 
 I take your hand 
 You'll find hope scribbled onto scrap pieces of paper 
 Like I found fate stuck to the curb 
 Save me now 
 I won't hold my hand out to anybody but you 
 There's still time to get hands around my fucking neck 
 It's time to realize that there is far more to this world that the self loathing you endure 
 You'll find hope scribbled on scrap paper
########### Broken Clocks ###########
Falling into stringencies 
 I never thought that I would be here 
 Dependence on, the evenings 
 I'm out of touch. 
 It's too late to hide what you kept hid 
 What explains with words were crooks 
 I'm falling out, x2 
 Of touch with myself. 
 I felt like this since forever, 
 This is killing me. 
 x2 
 What escaped, 
 Was what I dreamt then blurry eyes said the stories, 
 I'm broke apart, fading hours, empty dreams. 
 Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends. x2 
 I wore the same routines over every fucking night, 
 I'm beginning to lose faith in friendships, I. 
 I felt like this since forever, 
 This is killing me. 
 x2 
 Lift me up from this never ending fear of myself 
 Dependence on the evenings to get me through 
 Show me the line, I can't just walk away. 
 How much longer, 
 Can I break the same routines, 
 Blurry eyes, broken clocks, fading hours. 
 x2 
 Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends. x2
########### Early Grave ###########
I've been out for so long, days slipped by again 
 And I can't sleep since I stopped caring (x2) 
 I'll stay out until my lungs bleed 
 And I can't tell daylight from streetlights any fucking more 
 As he cast his shadow 
 I've seen this road a thousand times and 
 I can't look back 
 I've seen this road a thousand times and 
 I can't, 
 I'm not looking back 
 This is unfamiliar; death is no man's friend 
 Yet I'll stay here until I hear him roar 
 Death is screaming my name yet 
 I refuse to listen 
 Oh yea 
 I refuse to listen to him 
 OH 
 I refuse, I refuse, I refuse to listen 
 I'll stay out until my lungs bleed 
 And I can't tell daylight from streetlights any fucking more 
 As he cast his shadow 
 I've seen this road a thousand times and 
 I can't look back 
 I've seen this road a thousand times and 
 I can't, 
 Im not looking back 
 I can't sit here forever 
 Watch me rise again 
 Watch me rise back up 
 Forever would just be so, easy to fall into 
 Forever would just be so, easy to fall into 
 But still I'll stay out until my lungs bleed 
 Forever is the easy option 
 But I wont take it, I wont take it 
 NO 
 The choices I've made will lead me to an early fucking grave 
 Death is screaming 
 Death is screaming 
 Death is screaming 
 My fucking name.
########### Dethroned ###########
Another cold dark night, left alone 
 Your arrogance will lead to the death of you 
 I'll be the one to pull your head back down 
 Remove your hollow Crown 
 So far from the truth you hide away 
 I'll be the one to pull your head back down 
 Remove your hollow crown 
 I'll die happy knowing that I will never be anything like you 
 What gives you the right to silence me? 
 All my life I've wanted just to feel like this 
 You came, you conquered you gave it away 
 And how does it feel staring down on your idol's grave 
 The one you once looked up to has fallen into dust 
 The one you once looked up to has fallen away 
 What's left for you in this fickle world? 
 Remove your crown
########### Numbers Count For Nothing ###########
Every other question you'll never find the answer to 
 They can hear us but we will never see them 
 Do you feel safe? 
 Do you even understand me? 
 Do you even understand me? 
 We make no difference when numbers count for nothing 
 We make no difference if choices have been made 
 When your path has already been walked 
 When your hourglass is fooling you 
 What can you rely on? 
 Time is our only friend, now 
 If my life was to end today, It wouldn't change the world in any way 
 This sudden realisation is tearing me apart 
 This life is so perfect 
 What can be said of the end? 
 What will happen when our time comes 
 Who will stand the final test of time? 
 This life is so perfect 
 What can be said of the end 
 Will we be resurrected? 
 Who will stand the final test?
########### Follow The Water ###########
Can I blame it on you? 
 I just can't win 
 Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds 
 Can't seem to find a good excuse this time, for me and for this to fall apart 
 Shall I blame it on myself, or this routine that I've been stuck in? 
 I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine 
 But it's holding so f****** tight 
 I just can't handle another day of this 
 I just can't win 
 Get me out alive 
 Oh God, I mean it 
 These are violent days for you and me 
 I just can't handle another day of this routine 
 Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds 
 I've found my excuse this time 
 Your words are wearing me down 
 A constant frown upon my back 
 Follow the water 
 Drain the lake and bring it back to me
########### In Elegance ###########
Take your time to find me, 
 I can't promise where i'll be, 
 These nights I feel so restless, 
 Tonight I feel useless. 
 Take your time to find me, 
 I can't promise where i'll be, 
 These nights I feel so restless, 
 Tonight i'm useless! 
 Blaming myself for every wrong move I should've thought this through, 
 Before I pulled you down with me, 
 Motionless I lay, 
 When your words could save me from this situation. 
 I've been lying here for what it seems like days, 
 And it was my mistake from the start. 
 Take your time to find me, 
 I can't promise where i'll be, 
 It was my mistake from the start. 
 Take your time to find me, 
 I can't promise where i'll be, 
 It was my mistake from the start. 
 Motionless I lay with no words to save me. 
 Staring blankly into concerned eyes. 
 I needed the right words to become commendable. 
 I needed the right words but I just can't find them, I just can't find them. 
 OH! 
 I'll spend years making you believe I was just a bad dream, just a bad dream. 
 And it was my mistake from the start. 
 I've been lying here for what seems like days. 
 Take your time to find me, 
 I can't promise where i'll be. 
 It was my mistake from the start. 
 Take your time to find me, 
 I can't promise where i'll be. 
 It was my mistake from the start. 
 I'm determined to find a way out. 
 To disconnect myself from you again. 
 How can I? How shall I? My one chance, all to you. 
 How can I feel like I shattered my...oh...tonight? 
 I'll spend years making you believe that I was only a bad dream. 
 I'm determined to find a way out. 
 To disconnect myself from you again. 
 How can I? How shall I? My one chance, all to you. 
 How can I feel like I shattered my, one chance tonight?
########### We're All Alone ###########
I am your hero 
 Still I sleep alone at night 
 In years you'll thank me 
 For getting everything right 
 I am the sun 
 Still I sit alone in a red sky 
 Keeping my eyes on you 
 Were all alone 
 In time you'll find that 
 Were all on our own (all on our own) 
 Were all on our own , chasing nothing 
 My dreams have fallen , I'm wearing thin 
 I need something to fill this void I'm constantly in 
 And I can't do this 
 I am your hero 
 I just don't care tonight 
 In years you'll forget me 
 I got everything right 
 I am the sun 
 I didn't rise today 
 I left you in darkness 
 And I just don't care anymore about you 
 You can sit and suffer alone without me 
 I am your hero 
 Save your "thank you"'s 
 In times to come ill rise above this 
 But for now I can't ill just sit here 
 My dreams have fallen once again 
 My dreams have fallen once again 
 I need something to fill this void I'm in
########### Borrowed Time ###########
I'm looking back on a time when I could say I actually thought I cared about you 
 But after everything I've been put though 
 I realise that I've been living with false hope 
 It's drowning out my senses 
 It's drowning out my thoughts 
 This has got oh so confusing 
 And I've only got myself to blame 
 I can't believe...oh what was I thinking 
 I've only got my self to blame 
 You mean nothing to me 
 And you never fucking did 
 I can't stand to listen to your excuses anymore 
 I can only pray that you feel so alone 
 A guilty conscience hangs over your head 
 I can't believe...oh what was I thinking 
 I've only got myself to blame 
 But maybe I'm the only one to blame in all of this 
 I've got nothing to depend on anymore
########### Every Last Breath ###########
After all is said and done 
 I'm left with reflections of your eyes haunting my mind 
 So dead inside, what good came out of this? 
 I was the one that tore you down 
 I'm down yet oh so guilty 
 Every last breath I have is yours to keep 
 This constant cloud is watching over me 
 I wish I had the time to make you see this through 
 We've been here too many times 
 I've felt like this too many times 
 Oh god, I am this I'm dead inside, looking out for you 
 And your final words I was the one that tore you down
########### One Of These Days ###########
I admire your perseverance! 
 Everytime my back is turned your falling closer into my world, 
 I've told you so many times you need to back down, need to back down. 
 I told you you need to walk away. 
 All the countless efforts I have made. 
 One day I'll get you back, I swear I'll get you back. 
 Will this ever end or will time stand still forever? 
 Will this ever end or will time stand still forever? 
 Everytime my back is turned you're falling closer to my world. 
 How can you sleep when you know what you're doing to me? 
 Everytime my back is turned you're falling closer to my world. 
 How can you sleep when you know what you're doing to me? 
 I told you you need to walk away 
 Fuck all the efforts that I have made. 
 I've got you right where I want you. 
 After all the years I've known you when did you decide to fuck this up? 
 After all the years I've known you when did you decide to try and fuck this up? 
 I still admire your perseverance! 
 How did you think you'd get away with this?! 
 And it's time to teach you a lesson that you're never gonna fucking forget! 
 You are never gonna forget, not any time soon! 
 You're never gonna forget me! 
 Brargh!
########### Dead March ###########
I've watched you from a distance but never spoken a word 
 I have seen every flaw your try to hide from the world 
 I sit silent in shadows watching the paths you have made 
 If only you knew my intentions 
 I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over 
 This is not healthy 
 I need to some how stop this 
 But your beauty intrigues me 
 It seems to be pulling me in 
 All I want is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity 
 I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over 
 I only you knew my name and all of my motives 
 Yet I sit in the same place every night and wait for you to come back home 
 A few moments would help me find myself 
 But this problem has taken its tragic grip 
 Just a few moments will help me find myself again 
 If only you knew my name and all of my motives 
 I need to somehow stop this 
 All I need is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity 
 Something I can hold close to me
########### Left With A Last Minute ###########
It feels like someone is following my every footstep around every corner, 
 And there are times when I know I've felt someone else with me. 
 I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before. 
 I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before. 
 I'm never giving up till I find you. 
 I'll never rest until I find you. 
 I refuse to rest and I refuse to sleep until I have you in my sights. 
 It's gone too far. 
 A few steps behind. 
 Where are you now? 
 What is the meaning, why are you doing this to me? 
 What is the meaning, why are you doing this to me? 
 How can you do this? 
 I'll never sleep until I find you. 
 I swear I've felt your presence once before, 
 Or has my paranoia gone far too far? 
 I can't close my eyes without thinking that I'm losing control! 
 I can't close my eyes without thinking that I'm losing control! 
 I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before. 
 I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before. 
 I'm never giving up till I find you. 
 I'll never rest until I find you. 
 I'll never rest and I'll never sleep till I get my hands around your neck. 
 It's gone too far. A few steps behind. I'm coming for you now. 
 All I seem to hear in my head is your voice on repeat, 
 I close my eyes and I still fucking see you. 
 All I seem to hear in my head is your voice on repeat, 
 I close my eyes and I still fucking see you there!
########### Hollow Crown ###########
There, there must be 
 An easier way 
 To release these feelings 
 So, so far from home 
 I need your voice 
 To hold my head together 
 So, so far from home 
 I need your voice 
 To lift my lonely state of mind 
 You, you can't but wait 
 for me to return 
 For me to show you how I felt 
 These wounds have bled, 
 And pages fly by 
 I need to feel you right by my side 
 So, so far from home 
 I need your voice 
 To hold my head together 
 So, So far from home 
 I need your voice 
 To lift my lonely state of mind 
 Oh there must be 
 An easier way 
 Oh there must be 
 An easier way 
 Oh there must be 
 An easier way 
 To release these feelings! 
 (Whoa whoa!) 
 As the sea breeze hits my lungs 
 It takes me back, to where I belong 
 To where I belong 
 (Whoa whoa!) 
 As the sea breeze hits my lungs 
 It takes me back, to where I belong 
 To where I belong 
 As the sea breeze hits my lungs 
 It takes me back, to where I belong 
 To where I belong
########### Day In Day Out ###########
It could take a second 
 To tear down years of work 
 And we won't get these days 
 Back again (back again) 
 I can't understand why I've been put here 
 I'm stuck in a world of sympathy 
 With nobody watching over me 
 And the words roll over and over 
 Yet our hearts will never be lifted 
 Someone, tell me how I've ended up here 
 With nobody watching over me? 
 We need to bring back the days we used to love 
 Before all the colour drains away 
 I can't understand why I've been put here 
 I'm stuck in a world of sympathy 
 With nobody watching over me 
 I can't understand why I've been put here 
 I'm stuck in a world of sympathy 
 With nobody watching over me 
 To all those not living in the here and now 
 To all those not living in the here and now 
 To all those not living in the here and now 
 To all those (sing it loud) 
 Where did they go? 
 The days we used to know 
 Where did they go? 
 Have I forgotten what it feels like? 
 Where did they go / where did they go 
 The days we used to know 
 Where did they go / where did they go 
 Have I forgotten what it feels like? 
 And the words roll over and over 
 Yet our hearts will never be lifted
########### Learn To Live ###########
Picked yourself up, 
 Stop loving, start living, 
 Don't get held back, 
 That's where they want you to be. 
 I never paid much attention to them. 
 Every time they pushed us aside, 
 We got back up again, 
 Yeah we made it through the rain, 
 Just to live another day without them. 
 Pick yourself back up and learn to live, 
 Stop caring, stop thinking. 
 Picked yourself back up and learn to live, 
 The grass is greener on the other side, so don't give up on life. 
 Never back down, do this for yourself, 
 You don't need anyone to get you where you deserve. 
 I never paid much attention to them. 
 Every time they push us aside, 
 We jump back up again, 
 Yeah, we made it through the rain, 
 Just to live another day without them. 
 Every time they push us aside, 
 We jump back up again, 
 Yeah, we made it through the rain, 
 Just to live another day without them. 
 We are the ones you left out in the rain, 
 Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again. 
 We are the ones you left out in the rain, 
 Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again. 
 We are the ones you left out in the rain, 
 Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again. 
 We are the ones you left out in the rain, 
 Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again. 
 Here again... 
 We made it through the rain just to live another day, 
 We made it through the rain just to live another day, 
 We made it through the rain just to live another day, 
 We made it through the rain, the rain.
########### Delete, Rewind ###########
We are the misguided youth 
 They backed us into a corner 
 All our lives we've been infected 
 They should have never of had a chance 
 Because they're forcing us to believe 
 In a world we shouldn't trust 
 Delete, rewind 
 And try to change this state of mind 
 Give us something to believe in 
 Give us something to make our own 
 Give us something to believe in 
 Give us something to make our own 
 When will we stand up and choose our paths? 
 This is the end of the world 
 At least that's what we're told 
 This is the end of the world 
 Board up your windows and lock the doors 
 Turn out the lights, turn out the lights 
 Oh, this is getting old 
 We are the misguided youth 
 We sat back and lost our voices 
 Delete, rewind 
 Try to change this state of mind 
 Delete, rewind 
 And try to change this... 
 Because they're pushing us to the left 
 In a world we shouldn't trust 
 Delete, rewind 
 And try to change this state of mind 
 I don't believe you knew it all, you knew it all along 
 Delete, rewind, delete, rewind 
 When will we stand up 
 We've been through enough 
 When will we stand up 
 How'd we let them get the best of us? 
 When will we stand up 
 We've been through enough 
 When will we stand up 
 How'd we let them take the best of us?

It’s run down 
 The back of my head 
 The back of my mind 
 About a hundred thousand times 
 And I can’t 
 Seem to shake it 
 Seem to shake it 
 Addiction's tying me down 
 Pull me under 
 I can’t take it much longer 
 Pull me under

 Safe in my own skin

And I can’t 
 Seem to get a hold of this 
 This mess 
 Seems to be taking 
 Its grasp on every 
 Everything that we once worked for 
 And I can’t bear to watch 
 Everything just fall around me 
 And I’ve been struggling for so long, so long 
 And I’ve been looking for a way 
 To make everything fall into place 
 And when the red glazes over my eyes 
 There’s nothing anyone can say or do 
 Just you try and stop me 
 Try and stop what I have become, how I wish there was a way 
 And I’ve been struggling for so long, so long 
 And I’ve been looking for a way 
 To make everything fall into place 
 Everything just fall into place 
 Every word I ever said 
 Is making sense again 
 When the red glazes over my eyes 
 There’s nothing anyone can say or 
 Say or do

Stay young forever 
 You’ve done this to yourself or so, so it seems 
 You left behind everything 
 All your friends and all your family 
 Does it not feel slightly daunting 
 How you still sleep at night 
 When you must be able to hear them fight 
 It’s all about you 
 All about you 
 All about the way you choose to live 
 You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough 
 You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough

 Is there any point to this, are you even listening to us 
 You still left everyone you loved 
 Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half

########### Year In Year Out/Up And Away ###########
I’m astounded, I’m looking for a reason to leave 
 I’m astounded, I’m looking for a reason to leave 
 The years I’ve put into everything I have 
 Everything I am 
 I’m needing to find some peace of mind 
 To stop me leaving it all behind 
 These eyes have seen everything 
 But I’ll keep looking 
 It’s time to realize that my head 
 Is trying to take me down 
 It’s time to realize that my head 
 Is trying to push 
 Trying to push me out 
 I’m screaming out for help 
 Months 
 Years 
 Nobody hears 
 I’m screaming out, I’m screaming out 
 It’s time to realize that my head 
 Is trying to take me down 
 I’m screaming out to no-one 
 I’m astounded, still looking for a reason to leave 
 I’m astounded, still looking for a reason to leave 
 The years I’ve put into everything I have 
 Everything I am 
 I’m needing to find some peace of mind 
 To stop me leaving it all behind

 But I’ll keep looking 
 It’s time to take a step back 
 Look at my life and 
 Find a stable place to hide 
 It’s time to take a step back 
 Look at my life and find 
 A stable place to hide 
 It’s time to take a step back 
 Look at my life and 
 Find a stable place to hide 
 Stable place to hide 
 Live everyday like your last 
 And take nothing for granted 
 I’ll live everyday like my last 
 And I’ll take none of this for granted 
 Love as you want to be loved 
 And live the way that you know you should 
 Keep the good ones by your side 
 You never know when they might fly up and away 
 Forever in mind, my mind 
 I’ll be by your, your side 
 Forever in my mind, you’ll be there
########### The Bitter End ###########
When time resets, we all become zero. 
 Decimals apart, take us back to the start. 
 Tear down the walls, built to divide. 
 Can you feel that fire growing?

 We're standing on the edge of the event horizon, 
 Moments before the Earth starts to flatline.

The Son of God, hangman's pawn 
 Control our lives with fairy-tales and shallow lies 
 You say we'll burn in Hell… 
 Spiteful preacher, I know you well! 
 Desperation breathes and follows you home 
 Just look around– you're not alone… 
 One life, one chance; the world in front of me 
 Intelligent design, sending shivers up my spine 
 Cells mutate and divide 
 What a sadistic intention 
 No light! No dark! 
 No ups! No downs! 
 I'll find peace, buried in the ground 
 The lights go out 
 The fuse has blown 
 No Heaven or Hell to bring– me– home 
 You say we'll burn in Hell… 
 Spiteful preacher, I know you well! 
 Desperation breathes and follows you home 
 Just look around– you're not alone 
 One life, one chance; the world in front of me 
 Another division to tear us apart 
 Try to fill the hole inside your heart

########### These Colours Don't Run ###########
These streets aren’t paved with gold 
 Don’t believe everything that you’re told 
 Deception hides in all you see 
 Corruption hides in the air that you breathe 
 And in the land of the free 
 You know nothing comes for free 
 Fourth drive in paradise 
 Vapid souls check the market price 
 Lifetime slave living in a suburban grave 
 If there was a God 
 (…was a God…) 
 You would be the death of Him 
 These colours don’t run like colour from the face 
 Eyes roll back, chemical despair 
 It’s true what they say– life isn’t fair! 
 So repeat this line: 
 "Everything, everything is fine…" 
 So repeat this line: 
 "Everything, everything is fine…" 
 These colours don’t run like colour from the face 
 Eyes roll back, chemical despair 
 It’s true what they say– life isn’t fair 
 And in the land of the free 
 You know, nothing comes for free 
 I’m struggling to find any poetry in this 
 Someone beat me to the line: 
 "Ignorance is bliss…" 
 So I guess I’ll just say it how it is: 
 You had it all– YOU FUCKING PIGS! 
 These streets aren’t paved with gold 
 Don’t believe everything that you’re told 
 Deception hides in all you see 
 Corruption hides in the AIR– YOU– BREATHE!
########### Daybreak ###########
Navigation in nautical twilight 
 Separation from what we know is right 
 The wind was taking us in the wrong direction 
 It's about time we showed some disaffection 
 Carry the weight of thousands of years 
 Turn the page, let's make it all disappear 
 We've had enough of inhibited progression 
 Held back by cloak-and-dagger oppression 
 We're insulting our own intelligence 
 I won't listen without any evidence 
 I'll live my life in the name of no one 
 Bow your head, palm to palm 
 Worship here in this cerebral cathedral 
 As day breaks, the sunlight heals 
 As day breaks, the light reveals 
 These chains that we've been living in… 
 How easily we've been giving in! 
 Now shed this skin and let change begin… 
 As day breaks, the sunlight heals 
 As day breaks, the light reveals 
 Navigation in nautical twilight 
 Separation from what we know is right 
 It feels to me like this boat is sinking 
 Weighed down by rational thinking 
 It feels to me like this boat is sinking 
 Weighed down by rational thinking 
 Light begins to pierce the distance 
 Solar dawn, relieve the friction 
 Blue hours quicken the pulse 
 Upon the upper edge, reality dawns! 
 Light begins to pierce the distance 
 Solar dawn, relieve the friction 
 Light begins to pierce the distance 
 Solar dawn, relieve the friction!
########### Truth, Be Told ###########
Raging waters flood the valleys of your mind. 
 The torrent washed away the warning signs. 
 Swim through the ones and zero's, 
 So hard to tell the villains from heroes. 
 What if they say isn't true? 
 What if they want isn't best for you? 
 Washed up, face down on digital shores. 
 Lungs contract, now dive back in for more. 
 Are you sitting on the edge of your seat? 
 "We'll be right back, don't move an inch." 
 Static Mirror, life isn't black and white, 
 I understand it's hard to chose whats right. 
 Whiteout swallows us all. 
 Once snow-blind, we won't care at all. 
 Tunnel vision, 
 Hearts beats in time. 
 Rhythmic contractions 
 Drowning in a flood of distractions. 
 I want to wake up and find a world in remission, 
 Free from the grasp of the human condition. 
 But when we're all trapped inside static screens, 
 Trained from birth just to nod and agree. 
 I don't want to believe, 
 That we'll be forever, fast asleep.
########### Even If You Win, You're Still A Rat ###########
Your life is ending one minute at a time 
 Check the clock and stand in line. 
 Hibernate, till your life's passed you by. 
 Please stop living like you're waiting to die. 
 Keep up, keep up, 
 Don't get left behind 
 Don't slip up, slip up 
 Chase that finish line 
 They don't want you believing 
 That your life deserves a meaning. 
 Weary souls, trying to forget. 
 That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt. 
 What a feeling, built to break, 
 Happiness with an expiry date. 
 Please stop living like you're waiting to die. 
 Stitched into our lives 
 Drained until we expire. 
 Weary soul's trying to forget 
 That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt. 
 Keep two eyes on that intangible finish line. 
 In this race we're all reduced to vermin.
########### Outsider Heart ###########
I close my eyes and take a deep breath 
 Try to find my place in this… 
 Digging teeth into the hand that feeds 
 So inhuman, I'm surprised you bleed! 
 Cutting teeth, fading belief 
 Flip the switch and drag me in 
 When they've had their way– I doubt I'll even dream… 
 When they've had their way– I doubt I'll even dream… 
 I doubt I'll even dream! 
 Stray from the path and you're on your own 
 Lightning strikes in the unknown (the unknown) 
 The view from here, even the blind would see 
 That none of us were ever free… 
 I'll be the lines in between 
 The ones that tell you what you want and need 
 (You want and needed) 
 I am only rust on the machine 
 Amber corrosion 
 The loudest truth you never heard 
 A silent explosion 
 I am only rust on the machine 
 Amber corrosion 
 I'll be the lines in between 
 The ones that tell you what you want and… 
 Take my head from the clouds 
 Lift my feet from the ground 
 Take my head from the clouds 
 Last note dies, they don't make a sound 
 Stray from the path and you're on your own 
 Lightning strikes in the unknown (the unknown) 
 The view from here, even the blind would see 
 That none of us were ever free… 
 WERE– EVER– FREE!
########### Behind The Throne ###########
Sowing the seeds. 
 Roots dig deep, whilst we sleep. 
 Snakes in veins, valves decay. 
 All of the meaningless words we say. 
 Cast the first stone, from behind the throne. 
 Crown of thorns, now overgrown. 
 All our wants and needs, bring us to our knees. 
 Can't turn back now the seeds are sown. 
 Seven billion, one of a kind. 
 Collide together, intertwined. 
 National lines used to define, 
 Where we draw the enemy lines. 
 Weapons aren't used in this war. 
 Wait for the fallout from this absence of thought. 
 All the things we can't afford to ignore. 
 The sun doesn't shine anymore.

 Here is the house where you grew up alone.

 On our TV's, miles away. 
 On our doorsteps with no reason why.

 Remember this, remember this for what it was, 
 Oh, a bleak projection of absent minds. 
 You want a voice, but your voices sound like violence. 
 You shout so loud but all I hear is silence. 
 The city streets that you show no love are bruised and broken, 
 Because of you. x3

########### Feather Of Lead ###########
The sick get sicker while the rich get richer. 
 Capital greed paired with vestigial superstition. 
 The sick get sicker while the rich get richer. 
 Angels and demons, money and munitions. 
 Your left wing clipped, 
 Buy a gun for jesus. 
 Opportunities for all those willing to pay. 
 Out of sight, out of mind, 
 Too afraid of the horror that you might find. 
 Out of sight, out of mind. 
 How much does your faith cost? 
 Celestial shepherd watches over his flock. 
 What about those black sheep that he forgot? 
 Unanswered faith is everything that they've got. 
 I'd like to think you're everything that I'm not. 
 Something here doesn't add up. 
 Your charity starts and ends at home. 
 Your conscience called but you hung up the phone.
########### Unbeliever ###########
Our story began in the heart of a star. 
 We've lost our way, forgotten what we are. 
 We are only particles in motion. 
 Floating through space, what a destructive race. 
 Look at this life as a grain of sand, the blink of an eye, a world in your hands. 
 We're all thinking, feeling, surviving, believing 
 In what we think is right, refract distorted light. 
 You helped build this fire inside of me. 
 Breathing fire won't burn down the borders, 
 Set against everything that came before us. 
 All those things that you despise, we all see through human eyes. 
 There is no side to choose, bound together, we all win or all lose. 
 Life is so short, take a moment to feel alive. 
 I know all we meant was to expand and to thrive. 
 But we sharpened our claws and we went to war. 
 With ourselves, with each other, with the rich and with the poor. 
 With anyone different, who believes in less or more. 
 Step out of the shadow, cast by left and right wings. 
 Take refuge in each other and the triumph that it brings. 
 Since we stood on two feet, we've been worth so much more. 
 Now tear down the walls, that were built to divide, 
 It's time to extinguish that fire inside.
########### Rise Against ###########
Resist, rise against 
 Tuning out the message they sent 
 Waking up, things never felt so clear 
 All of it ceased, I want it to pass 
 Armed to the teeth 
 With words that give me some meaning 
 Cover up the mistakes that you made 
 You better believe this feeling won't fade 
 Digging deep, there's a long way to go 
 But there's some things that we want you to know 
 These pills must be bitter to swallow 
 What despair waits for us tomorrow? 
 This is only a matter of time 
 One day you're gonna pay for your crime 
 Armed to the teeth 
 With words that give me some meaning 
 Oh, I'm wide awake, but I'm still dreaming 
 I'm still dreaming 
 I'll clinch my name, I'm fading now 
 But we're not ready just to lay down and die 
 The clouds are smoke signals, so you'll find your way 
 Spread the word of the mess that we're in 
 This is a chance to live through my end 
 I'm wide awake, but I still hear you 
 Armed to the teeth 
 With words that give me some meaning 
 Oh, I'm wide awake, but I'm still dreaming 
 I'm still dreaming
########### Untitled ###########
The long walk home, 
 Back to a no name town. 
 Where people pass me by in red and white lines. 
 Your only son can't make you proud. 
 The moon and stars, this frozen clock. 
 And if in years to come we can talk like friends, can I close my eyes and wake up then? 
 Drown out the sound of adulthood with songs that fell from out of space. 
 At seventeen I wouldn't dare to dream because hope's a dangerous thing. 
 I won't thank god, I'll thank my friends, for sticking by till we're home again. 
 What matters most to me belongs to you. Hope's a dangerous thing. 
 I pinch myself to see, that if this curtain drops, this isn't me. 
 Pack my bags, no time to waste. 
 We leave no trace of us. 
 Still my pillow rings.

An iron fist in a velvet glove 
 Another vulture posing as a dove 
 Do you have no shame? Look at what you've become 
 You are the reason we are bitter and then some 
 Bitter and then some 
 They sing of saviors, we sing of sorrow 
 But we're still holding on for dear life 
 You sold us all down the river 
 I hope you choke on the vows that you failed to deliver 
 You said you'd change the world but death still flies east 
 The blind lead the blind, so we bomb for peace 
 Gravedigger, there's blood on your hands 
 You built this empire on salt and sand 
 Not all is fair in love and war 
 History repeats, we've seen this all before 
 We've given the vampires the keys to the blood bank, oh 
 They say, "The more things change, the more they stay the same" 
 Whilst the liars leech, the crooked preach 
 So lie through your teeth, lie like you mean it 
 In beggars belief, do you really think that we still fucking believe it? 
 You fucking parasite 
 There's no room in here for an honest man 
 Only callous and cold hearts 
 Gravedigger, there's blood on your hands 
 You built this empire on salt and sand 
 Not all is fair in love and war 
 History repeats, we've seen it all before 
 Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand 
 Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand

 They sing of saviors, we sing of sorrow 
 But we're still holding on for dear life

 We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true 
 Betrayer, hammer the nail 
 Such narrow lines separate me and you 
 So sick of the sound of people giving up 
 You can't stop me giving a fuck 
 Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on 
 Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on 
 With every concession, another piece of us dies 
 Will we fight for nothing if not our lives? 
 Apathy is our new messiah 
 Only He could let things get so dire 
 All the messengers found knives in their backs 
 Apathy is our new messiah 
 The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire 
 All the messengers found knives in their backs 
 I know it haunts you; it haunts me too 
 We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true 
 Why are we fighting, when I'm just like you?

God only knows why we were born to burn, uh 
 If God is my witness, He'll see that all is not well 
 Christ, what a sight for sore eyes 
 Looking down on us, all the children that You despise 
 God only knows why we were born to burn, uh 
 God only knows why we were born to burn 
 A bullet in the neck don't feel much like love 
 A message of rejection, sent from above 
 No flags, no holy books 
 I'll be in hell with the misunderstood 
 The sons and daughters that You wished to forget 
 A desperate picture of God's regret 
 Are we perfect mistakes or almighty fuck ups? 
 One thing's for sure; He doesn't fucking love us 
 He doesn't fucking love us 
 Hate must weigh on You like a broken cross 
 Hate; the dividing line we'll never step across 
 Outcast and reject 
 Outcast and reject 
 Father, Father, how I've let You down 
 A fucking tyrant in a hollow crown 
 Father, Father, how I've let You down

Hey, hey, they live this, day and night 
 This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise 
 Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist 
 Whilst the hunters hunt they will persist 
 This is where tragedy is bought and sold 
 It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold 
 You know they're here when the water is red 
 Our fading life support is hanging by a thread 
 A message etched on broken ships 
 Hey, hey, they live this, day and night 
 This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise 
 Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist 
 Whilst the hunters hunt they will persist 
 You can hear them cry 
 They're calling out to the Mother, lost 
 She's bleeding out 
 She's bleeding out 
 Their innocence is heaven sent 
 Their malevolence, it will not relent 
 A graveyard sits upon the shore 
 They won't swim together anymore 
 The tide will rush with waves of fear 
 Selling souls, the devil is near 
 The tide will rush with waves of fear 
 Selling souls, the devil is near 
 The devil is near 
 "If we're going to survive on this planet 
 We have to respect the right of all species to survive 
 For we need them more than they need us" 
 A message etched on broken ships 
 We'll be here till corruption quits 
 There is a voice though they cannot speak 
 Not yet ready to admit defeat 
 You can hear them cry 
 They're calling out to the Mother, lost 
 She's bleeding out 
 You can hear them cry 
 They're calling out to the Mother, lost

These martyrs seek no adoration 
 No promises of god's salvation 
 They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet 
 They hung the heroes 
 You've got to watch your back 
 You've got to swallow fear 
 Cover your tracks or you might disappear 
 They found the words to speak unspeakable things 
 They struck the air from the chests of kings 
 These martyrs seek no adoration 
 No promises of god's salvation 
 They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet 
 They hung the heroes 
 If you were caught between the devil and the deep blue sea... 
 Would you run and hide or stand for what you believe? 
 Maybe Orwell was right all along... 
 They think this spells the end, it's only just begun 
 These martyrs seek no adoration 
 No promises of god's salvation 
 They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet

 Swear that you won't forget 
 Swear that you won't forget! 
 If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun

 Tell the rats to get back in the gutter

 You try to stamp them out 
 You'll only fan the flames 
 This is for all the snakes: FUCK YOU! 
 So hold your forked tongues

This is the be all, the end all

 I've made promises that I know I can't keep 
 Drink from the holy grail, you'll find it's bittersweet 
 No matter what he says, poison is not my friend 
 But he'll have my back until the bitter end 
 Always climbing but only ever descending 
 The canvas before me is never-ending 
 So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods 
 If I drop this torch, then I'll be gone for good 
 I said "enough is enough" 
 Well, I guess I lied... I guess I lied 
 This is the be all, the end all

 All my mistakes will outlive me 
 I just can't accept that what will be, will be 
 My lungs are failing, I can't catch my breath 
 I don't know why, but right now I'm scared to death 
 My fear still sees when my eyes are closed 
 But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose

The past is dead! 
 I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace 
 The past is dead! 
 I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace 
 If we stop the clock, will I reappear? 
 Pulled from the drift— there goes another year 
 The stars align, the planets shift 
 All the infinite moments that we've missed 
 There's parts of me that are lost forever 
 At least we're all— lost together 
 We all remember youth like it's dead and gone 
 Like our favorite line from a forgotten song 
 I'll show you my hurt and I'll show you my heart 
 A life lost in the dark... 
 The past is dead! 
 I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace 
 The past is dead! 
 I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace 
 When I reach the end, will I beg for more? 
 Will I look back... or step through the door? 
 I stand beneath a monolith 
 Do you ever feel like you won't be missed? 
 There's parts of me that are lost forever 
 At least we're all— lost together 
 I heard that this was only a ride 
 So there's no worth in waiting for death to arrive 
 All we are, is just a name 
 It's who we are 
 Our skin, it shows these crippled bones 
 Youth sinks alone 
 All we are, is just a name 
 It's who we are

The distant blue... that's me and you 
 It was from there that we all grew 
 Framed in space, our first home

 We were disaster built from flesh and bone 
 Their bodies made a mountain, a ladder to the stars 
 When they reached up to the sun, it only left them with scars 
 All the saints and the sinners will reap what they sow 
 So they stood back and watched their bitterness grow 
 They couldn't tell the cure from disease 
 They no longer knew their want from their need 
 They fucked the future, forgot the past 
 Nothing built, was built to last 
 A common ground, now we see... 
 That connected us like the land and the sea 
 The distant blue... that's me and you 
 It was from there that we all grew 
 Framed in space, our first home 
 All those beating hearts that were made of stone 
 We were disaster built from flesh and bone 
 Caught in a web, don't struggle free 
 This is all we've got, so just let it be 
 If we save ourselves, we'll feel so small 
 We'll ask ourselves why we cared at all 
 Caught in a web, don't struggle free 
 This is all we've got, so just let it be 
 If we save ourselves, we'll feel so small 
 And ask ourselves why we cared at all 
 Why we cared at all...
########### Nihilist ###########
We are beggars, we are so fucking weak 
 And once upon a time we had the world at our feet 
 Well, we're all dying to meet our maker 
 But all our gods have abandoned us 
 All our gods have abandoned us 
 This is the great esoteric depression 
 We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation 
 We are all the shades of misery 
 The reigning champions of tragedy 
 They use their faith as a weapon 
 They count our sins by the seven 
 Blackwater at the gates of heaven 
 All hail the corporatocracy 
 The word of God written in binary 
 All hail our apostasy 
 The dying notes in an unholy symphony 
 All our gods have abandoned us 
 This is the great esoteric depression 
 We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation 
 I found God clutching a razorblade 
 He said, "Look at the fucking mess they've made 
 They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold" 
 We are beggars, we are so fucking weak 
 And once upon a time we had the world at our feet 
 Well, we're all dying to meet our maker 
 But all our gods have abandoned us 
 All our gods have abandoned us 
 All our gods have abandoned us 
 I found God clutching a razorblade 
 He said, "Look at the fucking mess they've made 
 They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold 
 But they're as worthless as the souls they sold"
########### Deathwish ###########
There was a time for change, I fear it came and went 
 Who's gonna pick up the pieces, who will be left to repent? 
 The sun is burnt out black 
 Now there's no turning back 
 Now there's no turning back 
 Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie 
 Turn a blind eye until the day we die 
 Maybe we've passed the point of no return 
 Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn 
 We just wanna watch the world burn 
 Our collapse will be remission 
 A planet scarred beyond all recognition 
 Suicide in slow motion, is this the path we have chosen? 
 Too cowardly to face this; we've got a fucking death wish 
 You want to play with fire? Don't cry when you get burnt 
 You gave us life, we gave back death in return 
 The sun is burnt out black 
 Now there's not turning back 
 We will consume until there's nothing left 
 Remember us as a waste of breath 
 Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie 
 Turn a blind eye until the day we die 
 Maybe we've passed the point of no return 
 Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn 
 We just wanna watch the world burn 
 I know you know that we've been living a lie 
 Maybe we've passed the point of no return 
 We just wanna watch the world burn 
 I want to believe that it all counts for something 
 The writing is on the wall 
 It's hard to accept that it was all for nothing 
 All for nothing 
 Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie 
 Turn a blind eye until the day we die 
 Maybe we've passed the point of no return 
 Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn 
 We just wanna watch the world burn
########### Phantom Fear ###########
Contaminated, nothing is sacred 
 Born and bred on pure hatred 
 'Cause they haunt our streets with a phantom fear 
 No one is safe, no one is welcome here 
 No one is welcome here 
 Can you taste the poison in the air? 
 I swear it's everywhere, it's everywhere 
 Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white 
 I'll chase the dying of the light 
 They want the victims to hang their heads in shame 
 Well fuck them all, we won't play their game 
 We won't play their game 
 I've seen through every word the prophets propagate 
 This is a failed state 
 So read between the lines 
 This is a failed state 
 No love, no empathy 
 Our fellow man is now our enemy 
 No love, no unity 
 Erase our souls, distort reality 
 Can you taste the poison in the air? 
 I swear it's everywhere, it's everywhere 
 Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white 
 I'll chase the dying of the light 
 They will sow the seeds of blind contempt 
 Then let us bleed until our heart's content 
 Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white 
 I'll chase the dying of the light 
 No love, no empathy 
 Our fellow man is now our enemy 
 No love, no empathy 
 No love, no unity 
 Our fellow man is now our enemy
########### Downfall ###########
They want all for one and none for all 
 I wanna be there to witness the downfall 
 They'll only sell us out when our backs are turned 
 And we'll keep paying the price until our lesson is learnt 
 So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin 
 Every snake has its price 
 If the money's on the table they don't think twice 
 So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin 
 We are paralysed 
 But there are none so blind as those who will not see 
 What's it going to take to get us to stand up? 
 'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck 
 About what matters to us 
 Another faceless figure, an empty silhouette 
 They'll line their pockets and leave us six feet deep in debt 
 So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin 
 Always out for blood, praying on the weak 
 We can count on them to paint the future bleak 
 But still we're standing by whilst they bleed us dry 
 We are paralysed 
 But there are none so blind as those who will not see 
 What's it going to take to get us to stand up? 
 'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck 
 About what matters to us, so enough is enough 
 What's it going to take to get us to stand up? 
 'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck 
 "Right" and wrong; it's all the same to me 
 Thick as thieves as far as I can see 
 They are leeches all 
 (They are leeches all) 
 "Right" and wrong; it's all the same to me 
 (Same to me) 
 Thick as thieves as far as I can see 
 (I can see) 
 They are leeches all 
 But we're still standing by whilst they bleed us dry 
 They want all for one and none for all 
 I wanna be there to witness the downfall 
 We are paralysed 
 They want all for one and none for all 
 I wanna be there to witness the downfall
########### Gone With The Wind ###########
The weight of my world is resting on thin ice 
 When the surface breaks will I find paradise? 
 As I freeze to death, left to reflect 
 What a waste of time I was in retrospect 
 I'd take a leap of faith but I'd lose my nerve 
 In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve 
 I'm always gone with the wind 
 Crawling in and out of my mind 
 God knows I lost all my faith 
 A sickness with no remedy 
 Except the ones inside of me 
 (Inside of me) 
 You ever wonder how deep 
 You can sink into nothing at all? 
 Disintegrate, annihilate me 
 Annihilate me 
 Do you remember when you said to me 
 "My friend, hope is a prison"? 
 Hope is a prison 
 Of all the patterns that I could create 
 I built a labyrinth with no escape 
 To keep myself under lock and key 
 I am my own worst enemy 
 I'd take a leap of faith but I'd lose my nerve 
 In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve 
 I'm always gone with the wind 
 Crawling in and out of my mind 
 God knows I lost all my faith 
 A sickness with no remedy 
 Except the ones inside of me 
 You ever wonder how deep 
 You can sink into nothing at all? 
 Disintegrate, annihilate me 
 A sickness with no remedy 
 Except the ones inside of me 
 (Inside of me) 
 You ever wonder how deep 
 You can sink into nothing at all? 
 Disintegrate, annihilate me 
 If I could silence all the doubt in me 
 Accept that what is meant to be 
 (Is meant to be) 
 You ever wonder how deep 
 You can sink into nothing at all? 
 Disintegrate, annihilate me 
 I remember when you said to me 
 "My friend, hope is a prison"
########### The Empty Hourglass ###########
Every moment is dead to me 
 Do you remember? Because I can't forget 
 The saddest story of all that ever was 
 Or will be, laid out before me 
 A living heart attack, play it back, play it back 
 Take my eyes, I cannot see sense 
 Past and future tense, every moment is dead to me 
 Safe and sound, anywhere but here 
 I see it crystal clear but it means nothing to me 
 It means nothing to me 
 It means nothing to me 
 Have you seen a future filled with regret? 
 Breathe and count to ten, start over again 
 You want to run away, just let yourself decay 
 A living heart attack, play it back, play it back 
 The empty hourglass, we're going nowhere fast 
 There's no more time to kill if time is standing still 
 Take my eyes, I cannot see sense 
 Past and future tense, every moment is dead to me 
 Safe and sound, anywhere but here 
 I see it crystal clear but it means nothing to me 
 It means nothing to me 
 It means nothing to me 
 Play it back, play it back 
 Over and over again 
 Over and over again 
 The empty hourglass, we're going nowhere fast 
 There's no more time to kill if time is standing still
########### A Match Made In Heaven ###########
Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow? 
 All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low 
 Sunk this low 
 (Rotten to the core) 
 So who's left to count the cost? 
 Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost 
 Now we're gone, left without a trace 
 But we took something they cannot replace 
 A match made in heaven paved the road to hell 
 We've been down this path before 
 Cold blooded retribution 
 So fuck your revolution 
 You chew up peace and spit it out as war 
 You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door 
 You are rotten to the core 
 We found your fingerprints all over the trigger 
 If you're looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror 
 You knew all along that the cancer would spread 
 So don't be surprised to find a price on your head 
 Sorry son but we destroyed your home 
 We murdered your family, now you're on your own 
 Collateral damage, face down in the sand 
 Watch the dominoes fall, it's all just part of the plan 
 A match made in heaven paved the road to hell 
 We've been down this path before 
 Cold blooded retribution 
 So fuck your revolution 
 A match made in heaven paved the road to hell 
 We've been down this path before 
 And every execution 
 The price of your collusion 
 Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow? 
 All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low 
 Sunk this low 
 You are rotten to the core 
 You are rotten to the core 
 You are rotten to the core 
 You are rotten to the core
########### Gravity ###########
This is a wake up call 
 No rise without the fall 
 Facing the great divide 
 You can run but you can't hide 
 You can run but you can't hide 
 I met the devil and God 
 And couldn't tell them apart 
 I thought I found the end 
 But it was only the start 
 I've heard it all before 
 Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you? 
 (Just let go) 
 Gravity, hold on to me 
 So come and wash us away 
 Just thank fuck that we don't last forever 
 (It's now or never) 
 Is this the catalyst? 
 Just let me burn the bridge that leads me nowhere 
 'Cause it's gone and it's never coming back 
 But make no mistake 
 It's just a matter of time before the wave breaks 
 So stand your ground, the earth will shake 
 So twist the knife 'cause I am finally awake 
 So come and wash us away 
 Just thank fuck we don't last forever 
 (It's now or never)

########### All Love Is Lost ###########
The workers all march to the beat of the drum 
 Their spirits are broken, they have nowhere to run 
 They dream of courage and a loaded gun 
 But the slaves all know they better bite their tongue 
 Track marks across the planet 
 Are there any veins left for them to infect? 
 They would kill one another just to disconnect 
 Three cheers for desperation 
 God bless the godforsaken 
 We will arm them to the teeth 
 To fight, to fight the war on peace 
 All love is lost, so carry the cross 
 'Cause there's no human in us left 
 We are music made for the deaf 
 They play a game that they know they'll never win 
 Sick and tired of the world they're living in 
 The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin 
 The workers all march to the beat of the drum 
 They fell into the trap, taken one by one 
 The medicine is poison but it makes them numb 
 'Cause all that they feel is pain and regret 
 Existence is just something they would rather forget 
 Three cheers for desperation 
 God bless the godforsaken 
 We will arm them to the teeth 
 To fight, to fight the war on peace 
 All love is lost, so carry the cross 
 'Cause there's no human in us left 
 We are music made for the deaf 
 They play a game that they know they'll never win 
 Sick and tired of the world they're living in 
 The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin 
 Is this freedom, is this the life you chose? 
 If this is living the dream, we've hit an all time low 
 All love is lost, so carry the cross 
 'Cause there's no human in us left 
 We are music made for the deaf 
 They play a game that they know they'll never win 
 Sick and tired of the world they're living in 
 The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin
########### From The Wilderness ###########
There is no end game 
 So whisper the truth and pass on the blame 
 Just put us out of our misery, this defeat is a victory 
 We're burning out, we're fading away 
 A failed evolution 
 Is the problem the solution 
 That they've been searching for? 
 We're waiting for the world to save itself 
 'Cause nothing is built to last 
 We're writing our epitaph 
 So reset and start again 
 'Cause we all know how this ends 
 Before long we'll be dead and gone 
 A thorn in the side of the earth 
 Where do you draw the line? A flaw in the design 
 The rest is history, this defeat is a victory 
 We're burning out, we're fading away 
 We're all guilty as sin 
 I feel it, I feel it under my skin 
 Always up in arms without lifting a finger 
 Lifting a finger 
 We may be infinite but this world is not 
 Something that we once knew that we long forgot 
 That we long forgot 
 We're waiting for the world to save itself 
 'Cause nothing is built to last 
 We're writing our epitaph 
 So reset and start again 
 'Cause we all know how this ends 
 Before long we'll be dead and gone 
 We're all guilty as sin 
 I feel it, I feel it under my skin 
 Always up in arms without lifting a finger 
 Lifting a finger 
 We may be infinite but this world is not

########### Memento Mori ###########
As above, so below 
 Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease 
 As within, so without 
 The seasons bring relief, let me live and die in peace 
 (Let me live and die in peace) 
 (Let me live and die in peace) 
 (Let me live and die in peace) 
 (Let me live and die in peace) 
 I will be consumed, returned into the earth 
 Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to 
 Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow 
 Cut the chord and cast me out, and cast me out 
 It's a promise that you cannot break 
 Was your life worth dying for? 
 The universe survives on give and take 
 Death is an open door 
 It's a promise that you cannot break 
 Was your life worth dying for? 
 The universe survives on give and take 
 Decay is the only law 
 As above, so below 
 Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease 
 As within, so without 
 The seasons bring relief, just let me live and die in peace 
 "Change 
 And everything is change; nothing can be held on to 
 To the degree that you go with a stream 
 You see, you are are still; you are flowing with it 
 But to the degree you resist the stream 
 Then you notice that the current is rushing past you and fighting you 
 So swim with it, go with it, and you're there; you're at rest" 
 It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone 
 It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own 
 It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone 
 It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own 
 When my heart skips two beats 
 I am hidden deep, fast asleep 
 The sea will part where oceans meet 
 Finally complete 
 It's a promise that you cannot break 
 Was your life worth dying for? 
 The universe survives on give and take 
 Death is an open door 
 It's a promise that you cannot break 
 Was your life worth dying for? 
 The universe survives on give and take 
 Decay's the only law 
 Swan song, a declaration of endlessness 
 I swear I will not look back as I return into the black 
 When the veil lifts, how will I know, how will I know? 
 Will I see God? 
 As above, so below 
 Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease 
 As within, so without 
 The seasons bring relief, just let me live and die in peace 
 "You can't hang on to yourself 
 You don't have to try to not hang on to yourself 
 It can't be done, and that is salvation 
 Memento mori: be mindful of death"

Hey, there's no price to life 
 When you're high on the white lie 
 (So lost, I've beat death) 
 White lie 
 (Kill us, don't tell us) 
 The devil that you know 
 Knows no, no death is too low 
 (Right when they want you) 
 To, to get lost, to be strong 
 Save us from the cure 
 With our heads in the sand we've left 
 Our lives in their hands 
 The chemical miracle 
 The one you've been praying for 
 With our heads in the sand we've left 
 Our lives in their hands 
 Our condition is critical 
 But we keep coming back for more 
 There's no price to hide 
 When you're high on the white lie 
 Hanging by a thread 
 Ready to drop dead

Oh, yeah! Oh! 
 When reason dies behind closed doors 
 Face down in a cell in a pool of piss 
 It's time to fear what we should respect 
 It's time to question cause and effect. 
 Striking with impunity 
 Hiding behind flags of immunity. 
 Striking with impunity. 
 Yeah! 
 When corruption rears its ugly head 
 The force of law becomes a farce 
 Personal ambition usurps justice 
 The rich protected at the expense of the poor 
 Would you sit on the fence, take no chance? 
 As those batons fall, turn a blind eye. 
 In an ideal world 
 There'd be no need for law 
 No need for police, 
 But in a society so sick 
 So obsessed with blind greed 
 Someone has to protect 
 The old and the weak. 
 Officer down! x3 
 Can we really afford to be so selectively blind? 
 If we dig too deep what would we find? 
 At authority's heart beats a dollar sign 
 Under such a regime we're all doing time. 
 Striking with impunity 
 Hiding behind flags of immunity. 
 Striking with impunity. 
 Never say, you weren't warned 
 When they come to drag you away 
 To silence the dissident hiding in us all 
 They clench the fist of ordained might 
 From which side of the barbed wire 
 Do you want to see your life pass by? 
 In an ideal world 
 There'd be no need for law 
 No need for police, 
 But in a society so sick 
 So obsessed with blind greed 
 Someone has to protect 
 The old and the weak. 
 Officer down! x3 
 Yeah! 
 When reason dies behind closed doors 
 Face down in a cell in a pool of piss 
 It's time to fear what we should respect 
 It's time to question cause and effect! 
 Who teaches the teachers? 
 Who makes laws for lawmakers? 
 When they read us our rights 
 What about human rights? 
 Yeah! 
 Never say, you weren't warned 
 When they come to drag you away 
 To silence the dissident hiding in us all 
 They clench the fist of ordained might 
 From which side of the barbed wire 
 Do you want to see your life pass by? 
 In an ideal world 
 There'd be no need for law 
 No need for police, 
 But in a society so sick 
 So obsessed with blind greed 
 Someone has to protect 
 The old and the weak.
########### Wait And Bleed ###########
I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 Good bye 
 I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time 
 Everything is 3-D blasphemy 
 My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up 
 This is not the way I pictured me 
 I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here? 
 Something about this, so very wrong 
 I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this 
 Is it a dream or a memory? 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 Get outta my head, 'cause I don't need this 
 Why didn't I see this? 
 But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate 
 I have sinned by just making my mind up and taking your breath away 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 Good bye 
 You haven't learned a thing, I haven't changed a thing 
 My flesh was in my bones, the pain was always free 
 You haven't learned a thing, I haven't changed a thing 
 My flesh was in my bones, the pain was always free 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 I've felt the hate rise up in me 
 Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves 
 I wander out where you can't see 
 Inside my shell, I wait and bleed 
 And it waits for you

["Blackloader" was originally written in 1995, and featured on our 1996 "Six Tears Of Sorrow" mini-CD. This as a brand new, completely re-arranged version.] 
 Nothingness in curves 
 Nothingness so present inside me 
 Woke up from my dream 
 Deafened by this ghostly silence 
 (It seemed so real) 
 I watched it all just scatter before me 
 Where did I go wrong? 
 Dreaming I was safe 
 But nothing is ever obtained 
 Another day in pain 
 Left behind to damn the crime that I ignore 
 And depend on my deteriorating reason 
 Values turn to nothing 
 Blackness colours the air 
 Negative resistance 
 To the urge of sweet fulfilment 
 (I lose control) 
 I watch it all just scatter before me 
 And I lose control 
 Dreaming I was safe 
 Dreaming all my life 
 My whole life... just a dream 
 Colours blend and fade away 
 Time has come for us to play 
 No more mystic poetry 
 No more space for you to be 
 All left is Black! 
 Feel the pain... I damn the crime that I ignore
########### NerveCurrent9 ###########
Swarming in doubt, you suffer of being 
 Sculpting a spirit, carving a soul 
 Your every fiber is infiltrated by pain 
 Not the last time I will torture 
 Not the last of my attacks 
 Sole on this surface 
 I will slip between the cracks 
 ...and sever! 
 Free to heal you 
 Free to kill you 
 All your fear could not destroy 
 My source of power unwithstood 
 This current through the nerve 
 Sectioning the endless cycle of life 
 Free to heal you 
 Free to kill you 
 Free to heal or to kill
########### Your Solid Waters ###########
Seeing your submission 
 Overwhelm the acid taste of life 
 Nothing more to offer 
 Consumed, diluted in the sky 
 Glow above the horizon 
 In a slow descending motion 
 Deeper down towards the heat 
 Liquid crumbles underneath 
 I once believed 
 Your Solid Waters 
 Could save a few more days for me 
 It hurts to see your beauty die 
 A formless mass devoid of light 
 Distilled from deception's bitter grains 
 Don't desire, don't believe 
 This empty crush, our raped creation 
 Floating broken, rained to rust 
 A copulation of disgust 
 The strength we shared, a nightly glare 
 Consumed, diluted in the sky 
 Submission lies under your Solid Waters 
 I once believed 
 Your Solid Waters 
 Could save a few more days for me
########### Heaven-Sent ###########
Heartlessly abandoned 
 At the highest peaks of chaos 
 Staring at the only path 
 My only path goes nowhere 
 A loss so overshadowed, so in vain 
 An atom spiraling through darkyears of pain 
 I'm on my way to meet hell deep below 
 Gracefully I am devoured 
 I see her break and crush and bastardize 
 Sudden escape from the upheaval 
 Leaves like porcupines pierce her skin 
 Soft, warm juices pour on my palms 
 Her contagious sensual mystique 
 Overwhelms me 
 I can't assimilate 
 Just cannot comprehend 
 This Essence Heaven-Sent 
 Outbalanced and painless 
 I sparkle with my empress 
 In an Essence Heaven-Sent 
 (I simply long to feel 
 What's too true to be real) 
 I must meet hell down deep inside 
 To break and crush all the inherent lies 
 Together we'll untie the vast intrigues 
 Together... we will control our lives !
########### The Seed Unsown ###########
Darkness nor helplessness 
 Have ever bloomed so lustfully 
 And feasted at the sight delicious 
 Of my lifeless substance sprawling 
 Softly I caress death 
 In this godforsaken hole 
 Cringe as it cruelly hides 
 The shattering wisdom behind 
 How the masters wander 
 How in self-esteem they bathe 
 How their misconceptions 
 Set all respect ablaze 
 Remains of my conscience 
 For the lowest bidder 
 Pumped onto plains unknown 
 I am the Seed Unsown 
 Vast knowledge is my loan 
 I am the Seed Unsown 
 How the masters wander 
 How in self-esteem they bathe 
 How their misconceptions 
 Set all respect ablaze 
 I am the Seed Unsown!
########### A New Dawn ###########
I recall a city of soil 
 Vision of order and hierarchy 
 Improbable creatures in a stone court 
 Punishing me for mistakes I cannot remember 
 My body's different, newly moving 
 Heavily into this space 
 A wave of unknown feelings rolls, 
 Collapses violently within 
 I recall a stellar junction 
 Universal sentinels 
 Throwing me into banishment 
 Like worthless gravel into the sea 
 My head is full of confused thoughts 
 This New Dawn tears my spirit apart 
 Or is it only just a common conscience? 
 This life will be an unreal leprosy I can't control... 
 Sorry for the things I do but I can't control myself
########### Freaqualized ###########
Best to crawl and leave no trace 
 These dusty paths call for a chase 
 Escape the sweet machinery 
 Thrusting oil like blood to burn in me 
 It cooks and boils and strives to prosper 
 Passive, I submit to failure 
 As I sense the sudden strength 
 Of one who knows and longs to hold my hand 
 Plummeting beyond control 
 Captured, force-fed, overruled 
 Stretch your arms and pull me back 
 Before clarity invades my eyes 
 Grab for gold that glows and gleams 
 And caress a truth beyond belief 
 A freight to dump on virgin grounds 
 To remain sealed and never to be found 
 Told about the paths you walked 
 Stolen, trampled, left behind 
 Bring your light astonishing 
 And once again be part of mine 
 ...But better crawl and leave no trace 
 And shut your ears and hide your face 
 The sickening truth I've given birth to 
 Is dwelling with fury, is out for you
########### Luminiferous ###########
What if we were not 
 (Tools by a deadly design) 
 What we hoped to be? 
 (Pieces to be inclined) 
 Sneaking after dusk 
 Banishing the perception 
 Of those cold breaths in the air 
 We gather courage 
 At night, our eyes are told 
 About suffocated places 
 What if we were not 
 (Tools by a deadly design) 
 What we hoped to be? 
 (Pieces to be inclined) 
 Don't know what we'll learn there 
 But our dreams have been insisting 
 And we're not resisting our need to know 
 Their care in secrecy is so convincing 
 We don't need to look far 
 Their breathing's frozen still 
 We only want to see 
 We don't need to look far... 
 Sneaking before dawn 
 Still remaining on our feet 
 Our questions are precise now 
 We need to look no further 
 Our eyes already know
########### FleshPlunge ###########
Wade through the mud 
 On this misty winter dawn 
 With the future only thoughts away 
 Ecstasy uncontained 
 At the sight of her sweet silhouette 
 Bathed in the humid morning mist 
 Alone 
 The cold breeze flows softly 
 Over her naked body... 
 I Plunge into her Flesh 
 Dark the emanations 
 Of her stream towards relief 
 My spine chills with passion 
 Doubt is a sickness 
 That spares the spirit 
 But relentlessly devours the soul 
 Delivered of all my fears 
 I shall doubt no more 
 And be who I am! 
 Forever out of sight...
########### Sunken Sin-King ###########
All the way in oh so deep 
 Digging to the core 
 Sickening being, vital seed 
 Always back to make me bleed 
 I am the murderer (in my dreams) 
 Just don't have the will to be 
 Someone pull my claws away 
 Help me please for it remains 
 ...A pointless twist 
 ...A shrieking cry 
 ...A Kingdom of Sins to rule 
 ...A living lie 
 Tremble 
 Tremble to the bone 
 Can't feel hatred leaving me 
 The blood of ends infinity 
 Surreal but right here in my hands 
 I'll leave you buried once again 
 My touch is the whip 
 That rips your flesh to shreds 
 ...A pointless twist 
 ...A shrieking cry 
 ...A Kingdom of Sins to rule 
 ...A living lie 
 I dream my will to life 
 I sink in sin tonight
########### Translucence ###########
Drowned in sin, 
 I caress death down deep below 
 In a slow descending motion 
 Blinded by this sickening truth 
 Surreal but right here in my hands... 
 The only truth lies in death 
 I am Pain 
 I am Pain! 
 Flames won't die out in Translucence 
 But forevermore shall BURN !
########### Friends ###########
Bright light almost blinding, 
 Black night still there shining, 
 I can't stop, keep on climbing, 
 Looking for what I knew. 
 Had a friend, she once told me, 
 "You got love, you ain't lonely," 
 Now she's gone and left me only 
 Looking for what I knew. 
 Mmm, I'm telling you now, 
 The greatest thing you ever can do now, 
 Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now, 
 It's very easy just. 
 Met a man on the roadside crying, 
 Without a friend, there's no denying, 
 You're incomplete, they'll be no finding 
 Looking for what you knew. 
 So anytime somebody needs you, 
 Don't let them down, altho' it grieves you, 
 Some day you'll need someone like they do, 
 Looking for what you knew. 
 Mmm, I'm telling you now, 
 the greatest thing you ever can do now, 
 Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now, 
 It's very easy just...ooh, yeah.
########### Emulate The Soul ###########
To observe and reconstruct 
 Defragment our very thoughts 
 To write the unspoken words 
 For every truth lies in between 
 To detain substential essence 
 So determined in their crime 
 Just an instant of awareness 
 For a lifetime of being dragged behind 
 While the chaos keeps crawling 
 And devouring, they gather 
 Like vultures coldly beholding 
 A world forever lost 
 On the path to magnificence 
 All uniques has dissolved 
 A cosmic multitude of one 
 Grasping to bypass impurity 
 And as I turn my face 
 Towards the ones who stab me 
 Stab me from inside 
 Every flaw is brought to light 
 For every truth lies in between 
 They infiltrate us with no reason 
 Other that to watch us crumble 
 Become dust as we deserve 
 This nauseating weakness seals our fate 
 Dissected to serve a cause 
 A vulgar emulation of the soul 
 Emulate the soul
########### Alteration ###########
Swallowed in this beauty's splendour 
 Contemplating the confines of infinity 
 I'll watch these glowing red grounds shatter 
 And crack and tumble down deep beyond imagination 
 I unleash the instincts 
 Take advantage, procreate 
 Through disillusions and rumbling memories 
 My renewal is worthy of their suffering 
 As I rise ... 
 I rise on alteration 
 This world means nothing 
 By my sole hand I'll build my reign 
 Bow down, you larvae, and spread open wide! 
 I will substitute your weakness with force 
 For it is I and I alone 
 And the universe lies in my hands! 
 You can't resist your urges 
 You're the alteration's womb 
 And on these shattered grounds 
 My claws inflict their final wounds
########### CrustScraper ###########
Cherish that which shines 
 Beneath a charred black crust 
 A treasure too enlightening to divulge 
 The very core of existence 
 Concentrated in one single being 
 I will wait until it blooms 
 The all within the one 
 And merge with her reflection 
 The shivering we will become 
 I will wait until it shines 
 The precious blinding star 
 I will dive into her waters 
 The thrill that grows into war 
 Haunting and addictive 
 I deify what roams inside 
 The diffraction of a mutilated soul 
 A purity no brandishing could induce 
 Immense the particle within the whole 
 Intensity - chaotic ascension 
 Surpassing gravity 
 Transcend spiritual convention 
 To magnify humanity
########### Capsized ###########
Float into the open space of thought 
 And see only what you will 
 Justify your belief by any means 
 Where do you choose to fall? 
 Deadly design has capsized 
 What if we were the conscience 
 Intruded by their light? 
 We have to look further 
 What if the only secret 
 Resided in our minds? 
 Behold sanity shatter 
 When the insides start to rumble 
 You know there's another way 
 Free to let your certainties evolve 
 Never settle until the grave 
 Rumbling, breaking, tumbling, quaking 
 Can't stop before each den of my mind's taken 
 Rumbling, breaking, tumbling, quaking 
 Won't stop until all of her senses awaken
########### The Resonating Cycle ###########
Can't ignore what leaps towards me, gnawing at my skin 
 Can't resist the unreal beauty of otherworldly sin 
 So appeasing in this poison, all senses focalise 
 Desperate to bring a newfound truth before my eyes 
 ...Before my eyes 
 Staggering depths and heights 
 Hypnotized I swirl out of sight 
 Resonating 
 Can't deny determined I believe all gods prosper in lie 
 Yet no science can occult this vestige of a different life 
 Fearless shapes crawl and mingle deep inside the sterile vacuum 
 Their flow of thoughts decodes within my mind 
 ...Within my mind 
 Limitless resonance 
 Bouncing back and forth through time 
 Resonating 
 Capture and absorb 
 Decode the flowing mass 
 All my senses focalise 
 All that comes has already passed 
 Heavy is the curtain falling 
 So appeasing is this poison 
 Feel that all these thoughts are mine 
 Feel that all these thoughts are mine! 
 Long since adrift into the unforeseen 
 I'll dream forever of what could have been 
 ...Before my eyes 
 Staggering depths and heights 
 Eternally resonating life
########### The Path To Apoptosis ###########
Visionary madness - a parasite's morphology 
 Submit all that can serve and plunder with impurity 
 Break what will not bow through nanotech control 
 Nothing shall withstand when human pretence unfolds 
 Proliferating leakage in the mechanism of reason 
 Tantalize the birthing ground for total domination 
 Self-contagious sickness leaves the imperfect behind 
 Every life requires death but this phagocyte is blind 
 Purity is drifting away 
 (Along the Path to Apoptosis) 
 Disappear in the cascade 
 Of a programmed suicide call 
 Visionary madness 
 And its consequential fall
########### Futile Resilient ###########
Smash the flesh 
 Hard as you can 
 And let it come to me... 
 Pain is for the innocent 
 Feel its burning radiation 
 In solemn hideaways 
 It seeks continous execution 
 Silently, they all relent 
 Subdue the tide that turns 
 Pain spares not the strongest 
 In this stillborn universe 
 Smash the flesh 
 Hard as you can 
 I'm careless, so careless about death 
 All resistance is futile... 
 Observe myslef and grin 
 Like each one of them I struggle 
 But one simply can't escape 
 My fate is just the same 
 Unavoidably 
 Pain is for the strongest 
 So flourish all your hate 
 And make me suffer

["Serpent Speech" was originally written & performed by Entombed. Check it out on their killer 1993 EP "Hollowman"!]
########### Infertile Ways ###########
We have reached a point in existence 
 Where the predicted end leaps forward 
 Infiltrating our subconscious 
 Until every motive caves in 
 We have witnessed the elements withdrawing 
 Interfering devastation 
 Countless particles absorbing 
 The perfect world we never should have reached 
 And helplessly we watch 
 As the turbulence completes 
 To erase Infertile Ways 
 Open wide your privileged eyes 
 Be the prophet of your own demise 
 For the meaning of the present 
 Lies in its affection to the future 
 You shall see what you're about to be 
 You shall teach what we have never learned 
 You'll imagine the knowledge to foresee 
 You'll achieve what we have left undone 
 Erase our Infertile Ways!
########### Mirthless Perspectives ###########
Now that the bleeding is even 
 The ineluctable settles inside 
 To remain inert forever 
 Somewhere something has died 
 Capture echoes of the end 
 In uncommon lucid moments 
 Strain our eyes staring 
 Where there's nothing to be seen 
 Mirthless perspectives 
 Perpetual imbalance 
 Kill-conceived instinct 
 A spiritless battle 
 Doomed to be lost 
 Running fast and fearless 
 Hooked onto our empty shells 
 A profound sensorial burn-out 
 Switched off all remaining reason 
 Blinded numb with shock 
 Somewhere something has died 
 Simply heading towards the day 
 When our suffering will subside
########### An Emptier Void ###########
Unrelayed, bite right through 
 Curse the weight that strains your mind 
 Stationary, facing nothing 
 It devours you from inside 
 Short-lived passion, now inflamed 
 Realize you've spilt the essence 
 Boiling over, flesh melts fast 
 Liberate the key to vengeance 
 I'm not the one to steer this 
 My duties are fulfilled 
 Take the strain and struggle 
 The endless downhill 
 From a reasonable distance 
 All seems strangely quiet 
 Take just one step closer 
 And be entangled in my spite 
 Jackhammer comes crushing 
 Pounds to pulp with no relief 
 Bite the dust and chew it well 
 Suffering's all I can give 
 I'm not the one to steer this 
 My duties are fulfilled 
 Take the strain and struggle 
 The endless downhill 
 Wreack havoc on my path 
 Strike back with blinding rage 
 Nothing can hold me back 
 None will be saved 
 Each second the need is growing 
 To fill this enveloping void 
 Each instant without passion 
 Leaves me emptier still
########### Irradiant ###########
At every breath, he drains out 
 Strips off and goes blind 
 No longer does he unveil the adapted codes 
 No longer does he protect the private passages 
 Irradiate the web that steers us towards the end 
 They swarm and hack 
 At the irradiant atmosphere 
 Their brain-wrecking venom 
 Tears each thought apart 
 So fast and vicious, they kill 
 With an immense cruelty 
 They proceed threateningly 
 To spread their infernal chaos 
 No one can reach the source of his venom 
 Inheritance of a sadistic unconciousness 
 Condemned to wander in this living labyrinth 
 Endlessly pursuing his possessed limbs 
 Each wall is a mirror, each refelection is torture 
 His interior light doesn't cast any shadow 
 His mutilated spirits united for a colossal eternity 
 Too impatient for a virtual resurrection 
 He finally exhales his pain in a twisted echo 
 Contaminated by a disease which death cannot end
########### Asphyxiate ###########
In the end, everything is said. A state of mind one can only regret. 
 Touch truth but only skim perfection. Plunge beyond this painful deception. 
 There is a way for it all to happen, a riverbed where everything can flow. 
 Harsh memories scattered around, no promise on which to bestow 
 This world, a burden of pain 
 Asphyxiate this sickening state 
 Straight ahead to the place we belong. Looking back, it all seems so wrong. 
 There must be a way for us to see, and dive past each miscalculation. 
 Fear is the stone cold murdurer, the rampant virus contaminating 
 This world, a burden of pain 
 Asphyxiate to recreate
########### Hyperconscience ###########
Floating towards the cosmic essence 
 On which your sanity keeps leaning 
 Every single nerve manifests it's presence 
 And still you're asleep and dreaming 
 Even the sixth sense is now awake 
 An entire existence is at stake 
 The palpable tension makes your blood overflow 
 A new seed is planted and ready to grow 
 Visual rays like razorsharp laserbeams cutting through the cold obscurity 
 Aural perception of the slightest movement in this all-enveloping universal void
########### The Perfect Disaster ###########
Gliding sideways, a motionless contortion 
 Suddenly leaping towards me 
 A light in the distance prevails over reason 
 To grasp what remains but an instant 
 Life ploughed over with glorious laughter 
 So receptive to this perfect disaster 
 Whispered words burnt in my soul 
 Nothing more than I need to know 
 Infinite the laws of chaos 
 My existence is the token 
 Relic of mortality 
 The barriers are bound to be broken 
 Perforate every inch of tissue 
 Plunging headfirst into the liquid 
 Inner darkness shining through 
 Absorbs the deepest of your being 
 Life ploughed over with glorious laughter 
 So receptive to this perfect disaster 
 Whispered words burnt in my soul 
 You're all I ever need to know
########### Molten Scars ###########
First war was born before the completion of creation 
 Our words lit up and stained our souls with quivering shadows 
 Scarved until our time comes, will you choose to join in? 
 Banished from this doomsday, our scars will emerge 
 Scars are eternal (immaculate skin never remains) 
 Infinite the laws of chaos 
 My existence is the token 
 Relic of mortality 
 The barriers are bound to be broken 
 Eternal repulsion of profound bliss - don't tear up the missing pieces 
 The healing frightens the shores of your wounds - don't tear up your missing pieces 
 Scarved until our time comes, will you choose to join in? 
 Banished from this doomsday, our scars will emerge 
 Glue my molten scars back together, decorate the well that pierces my eyes 
 Light the candles, burn my ice-cold skin, watch... and sigh!
########### Fireproven ###########
Precognition, imminent catastrophe 
 There's no way we'll ever learn 
 Asepticize, stand apart or be set aside 
 Evolution takes a stranger turn 
 Burning through thick layers of scale 
 Infiltrating the intimite beings 
 Second to none, submit and enroll 
 Transparent the unseen chords of control 
 Fireproven - will I stand the test of pain? 
 Omniscient belief in the answer 
 Understanding, the key to all power 
 The last inch of virgin magic was raped 
 By our inertial reference frame
########### Boiling Calm ###########
My subconscious battles it's way to the surface 
 Roaming through the wilderness that always prevails 
 The shell cracks open, releasing sheer madness 
 The certain man is the man who fails 
 To see will never again be to believe 
 In nothing I couldn't ever place my trust 
 Where projectiles plummet and overshadow 
 The last shred of sanity is bound to leave 
 Luminous ages of infinite reflection 
 Permanently misleading me from reality 
 Neural transformers deprived of connection 
 There are no more words left to be spoken 
 Numb suffering arises from out of nowhere 
 Defying any logical sense of belief 
 If this is how soul and spirit fornicate 
 I'll run all the way to hell and remain there 
 Boiling with disgust, I never meant to be this way 
 Bleeding of my guilt, I never meant to be this way 
 The death of a being slowly closes in - every spare second, a breath is taken 
 And when it all comes down to the end, theres no more meaning to the horror called sin
########### Endangered ###########
Concealed in this refuge 
 When the urges to selve 
 Headfirst into the dark 
 Grow too strong to resist 
 Endangered I come alive 
 Feel my instincts pulsating now 
 Endangered I breathe new life 
 Angst, a second awakening 
 My eyes caught a glimmering light 
 Some strangely unexpected sign 
 Triggering all this beyond 
 My wildest nightmare 
 How to elevate oneself 
 Above clouds of mediocrity 
 When the only open road 
 Leads directly to rivalry 
 Insecurity so vital 
 Ever-changing, non-revealing 
 Ineluctably reinforces 
 This jaded resignation 
 Endangered I come alive 
 Endangered I've reached new life
########### Imperceptible Armageddon ###########
Fear what I see 
 Something unknown reflecting in me 
 A new parameter leaves its imprint 
 Feel so naked 
 Stripped of what once was a soul 
 Defeated Unsuspectingly 
 Inescapable refraction 
 Recurrent phase in deconstruction
########### Senseless ###########
Burning me out 
 Pulling me down 
 Gnawing at me 
 Devouring me raw 
 Shut myself off 
 Far too Unworthy 
 Dreams is my shelter 
 Senseless I will be 
 Can I take it all ? 
 Leaping and screaming 
 In from all sides 
 Melting and weaving 
 Locked in the ride 
 Turn myself out 
 Yearning for empty 
 Dream is my shelter 
 Senseless I will be 
 Hack my way through evolution 
 Stand and embrace evolution 
 Some jewels must remain untouched 
 Can I take it all and face myself ? 
 Some illusions must remain enthroned 
 I will take it all!
########### The Plundered ###########
Fallen too deep 
 To live by a vow 
 No contemplation 
 It's here and now 
 This is me and my need 
 Don't even waste a through 
 Just inhale and absorb 
 Take it all away 
 I exalt my emptiness 
 Take it all away 
 Feed on you till I'm done 
 Carry out denial 
 Nestled within me 
 Quicksand has swallowed 
 The guidelines I lived by 
 My granted existence 
 The center of all 
 Unprepared to face the day 
 When rights will be reclaimed 
 Resources dropped to nil 
 I pillage my way through this maze 
 Blind steps to the trapdoor 
 That beckons me to my fall
########### Assuming Self ###########
His eyes translate an 
 Uncontrollable fury 
 His dislocation jaw 
 Grows in a groan 
 He moves only at 
 Insanity's request 
 When the hope of a 
 Victory becomes dismal 
 The wisdomless man 
 Exhausts himself 
 Hiding in his den 
 He cooks his fears 
 But time and time again 
 He passively observes 
 The collective slaughter 
 Always the same principle 
 A mortal lack of confidence 
 He doubts about the nature 
 Of his instinct 
 Disguise your thoughts 
 And implore the fury 
 Kneel down before 
 The altar of light
########### Fathomless Descent ###########
Flattened out, corroded 
 Filtered till the last drop 
 Enlacing my damnation 
 Disappeared at the last stop 
 Digging way too deep 
 Wearing out my very core 
 One glance at this illusion 
 There's no exit anymore 
 All merged into disarming bliss 
 Steep hills transformed into chains 
 I'm bound to my uselessness 
 Pay heed, wanderer 
 To these killings in disguise 
 It matter not how deadly 
 All treasures glow from afar 
 Innocence laid to waste 
 Bitterness becomes my taste 
 Gold-plated failure at a breakneck pace 
 Fathomless descent
########### A Few Scraps Of Memories ###########
Inhale this sweet parfume 
 Of acid Sulphur 
 Spit yourdespair 
 In humiliating joy 
 Sweat from all your pores 
 Burnt by the anger 
 He's in you, he's everywhere 
 He stabs you where it hurts 
 He's the creator, the only one 
 He's back to never leave again 
 What would the spirit 
 Be if it could burn? 
 Evaporating in an 
 Asphyxiating atmosphere 
 Polluted by the shockwaves 
 Of its predecessors 
 Contaminated by a disease 
 Which has only just begun 
 Disappointed, speechless 
 Copses are falling one by one 
 A psychic desolation storm is on its way 
 Deserters are legions, 
 Digging their graves 
 Lay down, close your eyes 
 Sprawl in your insane certainty 
 You ain't pleading anyone's cause 
 A few scraps of memories... 
 Your cosmic rictus greets him 
 He dominates you with his 
 Dictorial behaviour 
 You offer all your light to his darkness 
 He drowns you in eternal 
 Sadness and locks you away 
 What would the soul be if it could shine? 
 Free from all its virtual sins 
 Like a flame spreading through a shadowy passage 
 Lost to his sight of pixelated memories
########### Rebirth ###########
Questions poisoning my drive 
 Angst straight on its murder-course 
 Can't refrain from emptiness 
 Keeps on seeping through my pores 
 Don't belong, never have 
 No way to claim who I am 
 Failed once, never again 
 No way to ease this suffering 
 Down below where light is dim 
 I am cornered by my fear 
 Never seem to get a grasp 
 Distance what I hold so dear 
 Have no choice but to return 
 To this place of broken dreams 
 Push my soul towards the edge 
 Face myself as darkness beams 
 Died here time and time again 
 Wreated evil paved the way 
 After all that we've survived 
 Could you have me lead astray? 
 No place where I can just let it die 
 Don't set your foot in here 
 You don't belong here 
 Cavity becoming me 
 Don't set foot here 
 Don't belong
########### Fire Proven ###########
Precognition, imminent catastrophe 
 There's no way we'll ever learn 
 Asepticize, stand apart or be set aside 
 Evolution takes a stranger turn 
 Burning through thick layers of scale 
 Infiltrating the intimate beings 
 Second to none, submit and enroll 
 Transparent the unseen chords of control 
 Fire proven will I stand the test of pain? 
 Omniscient belief in the answer 
 Understanding, the key to all power 
 The last inch of virgin magic was raped 
 By our inertial reference frame
########### Hyper Conscience ###########
Floating towards the cosmic essence 
 On which your sanity keeps leaning 
 Every single nerve manifests it's presence 
 And still you're asleep and dreaming 
 Even the sixth sense is now awake 
 An entire existence is at stake 
 The palpable tension makes your blood overflow 
 A new seed is planted and ready to grow 
 Visual rays like razorsharp laserbeams 
 Cutting through the cold obscurity 
 Aural perception of the slightest movement 
 In this all-enveloping universal void 
 Hyper Conscience 
 The highest of creatures would be in control 
 Of a sentiment so profound 
 Synaptic currents will take their toll 
 Unless equilibrium is found 
 Emotions quarrel restlessly 
 Rapid eye movements of the third degree 
 Yet there is only one single path: 
 The illogical road of universal truth 
 An air-like skin so transparently liquid that a single atom would scratch it 
 Electromagnetic captors of a scent piercing thick concrete mass 
 A sweet salty taste dividing the divine from the utter darkness
$$$$$$$$$$ solace $$$$$$$$$$

########### Man Dog ###########
My breath is out before me 
 Sweat run to my eye 
 The way that I'd been told 
 Is not the way we die 
 Rounding every corner 
 Steady as it flies 
 Past the souls of others 
 Free now of the lie 
 Farther away a thunder rolls 
 Well on its way an end unfolds 
 Tranquil in its terror 
 Midnight serves me well 
 Stealing those around me 
 From nowhere 
 Watch the hour 
 Stakes are on the tower 
 High walled thunder 
 Drags you so far under 
 Farther away a thunder rolls 
 Well on its way an end unfolds 
 Darkened season brings a switch 
 And withered is our trust 
 Leaves you stolen damned blindsided 
 Cast down out of touch 
 Nearer sounds the voice of many 
 Fair the hand was not 
 Now it is that I'm reminded 
 Of all you forgot 
 Nearer sounds the voice of many 
 Fair the hand was not 
 Now it is that I'm reminded 
 Of all you forgot 
 Stole my time 
 Taint my sun 
 No more mine 
 Pain is one 
 Darkened season brings the switch 
 Withered is our trust 
 Leaves you stolen damned blindsided 
 Cast down out of touch 
 Leaves you stolen damned blindsided 
 Cast down out of touch 
 Now it is that I'm reminded 
 Of all that you forgot 
 Stole my time 
 Taint my sun 
 No more mine 
 Pain is one 
 Try to keep my wits at me 
 Pushin' on are you 
 Absorbed it all and much too soon 
 And so it is and there 
 And when I've said and spoken truth 
 And felt life in me rare 
 It was that I could sense a sense 
 That no one fucking cared 
 So it's to the end 
 Now there's a dead tomorrow 
 And you drive it in 
 To make sure I am done 
 But it's coming back on through 
 To keep on fucking you 
 Time to reap the pain 
 That you had borrowed
########### Black Unholy Ground ###########
Black unholy ground 
 That time away that traps and plays 
 With all i try to do 
 Might help to lead or open bleed 
 And know that i'll know soon 
 To find i'm here can burn and seer 
 But up the hill i go 
 Controlling but the sky it fell 
 Rejoining with a war to tell 
 Free 'til the end 
 To find i'm here can burn and seer 
 But up the hill i go 
 The path shrouded 
 The wrong touted 
 Just like it's always been 
 Controlling but the sky it fell 
 Rejoining with a war to tell 
 Dead rain unseats a king who dealt 
 Free 'til the end 
 Remember the flood 
 I've stumbled here again 
 And where are you all 
 Only sad it hits 
 The wind won't sound and scream to break the hold 
 This is no place to be 
 Heading somewhere i've been shown not to go 
 Cannot stop what you already see 
 Remember the flood 
 I've stumbled down here again 
 And where are you all 
 Only sad it hits 
 I stole down the way 
 The cold double cross 
 No peace in running 
 Stand with the loss 
 Controlling and the sky it fell 
 Rejoining with a war to tell 
 Dead rain unseats a king who dealt 
 Free 'til the end 
 Used to think that it had run its course 
 Used to be that it went south
########### Suspicious Tower ###########
You're wrong 
 Doesn't cease to amaze me 
 You're head 
 Ego bound 
 You fool 
 Only you in the long run 
 Come down 
 From on high 
 I can't negate it 
 You listened way to long 
 You hold on 
 Like you know that it's over 
 Give like it hurts 
 Applaud 
 Like you've heard it all before 
 Only hear 
 The things you've heard 
 I can't forsake you 
 The past can tear you up 
 Cross a land mine 
 Beat the fire-line 
 Come the water's time 
 Climbing up to the still of the eye 
 Fool 
 Only you in the long run 
 Come down 
 From on high 
 Sell your bag of wind down the road 
 Take your hands from down my throat 
 Can't waste my air breathing in you 
 Just like a stone I can't break through 
 I can't negate it 
 You listened way too long 
 I can't derail it 
 You're too far from too far gone
########### Heavy Birth / 2 Fisted ###########
Taking steps to nowhere 
 Waking, miles away 
 Dwelling, sucks the life out 
 But it's inside where I have seen 
 Traces, things I'm made of 
 Buried, and lost away 
 Small walk, scarred deserver 
 How long, to feel you there 
 Been dead too long 
 Bracing, for the worst now 
 Ever, simpler things 
 Forming, the silent strong hold 
 In the corners of a smile 
 Faced with no concern 
 Or presence of mind at all 
 A face wind, meets me empty 
 And makes clear, a seasoned fall 
 Been dead too long 
 To know the earth and stand again 
 Connected to the spine again 
 Regret that fought to take 
 Command 
 Of my heart, of my heart, of my ...
########### Forever My Queen ###########
I'm running away with myself 
 I think I ran a little too far 
 Your love is more than a tease 
 And I'm gonna give it all of my heart 
 The situation is all wrapped up 
 No more need to be said, oh no 
 You live in my world gotta heed me 
 And I know that you can 'cause you need me 
 There ain't nothin' gonna stop us now 
 We're willing and we both know how 
 And baby, you're gonna be my queen 
 The king always knows what he means 
 Alright - Look out
########### With Time ###########
What have I done, why am I hated 
 Everything has just begun to be updated 
 Have I been aware of my friends 
 Or just unfair of myself and of my pride 
 Should I change for my best 
 Or should I live my life in a mess 
 I'm the one who's lost inside 
 But you're the one I can't find 
 Feel confused and lonely at this moment 
 But maybe with some time, everything will 
 Pile off my mind
########### We Bite ###########
We walk the streets, I'm out to get you We bite 
 Just a feast of gore and blood We bite 
 Carnivores live for pleasure We bite 
 Strike out like a wolf's endeavor We bite 
 And when I get your blood I rip your throat 
 Your blood I rip your throat 
 I want your blood, I rip your throat 
 Drink some blood 
 We bite 
 We bite 
 We bite

 And when I get your blood I rip your throat 
 Your blood I rip your throat 
 I want your blood, I rip your throat

########### Silence Is Acceptance ###########
This mask upon my face I can feel. 
 It's beautifully cold (crying out, breathe) 
 Like iron. 
 A heavy chain carved from my own tombstone. 
 Bonded by the silence. 
 The silence is broken as is the bond and 
 I fall apart before this.
########### The Coals On Which I Walk ###########
My eyes rise to see you. 
 Your heart longs for me. 
 My bones stretch beneath you. 
 God please let me see. 
 A heart that only wants you. 
 My heart longs to see. 
 Jesus come and heal me. 
 My knees unfold only to you. 
 Can my life be more like you. 
 I need to fall with you again. 
 My eyes start to wander. 
 My feet begin to stray. 
 Our love wants to deepen. 
 My heart runs away. 
 Your knees bleed to find me. 
 My heart comes back to stay.
########### The Scarlet Red ###########
Stained. 
 Pierced. 
 The scarlet red flowed like wine. 
 Imperfect they called you. 
 Scarred. 
 Your crimson stained my blackened heart. 
 Your words a flaming spear. 
 My flesh scalds away. 
 My soul is pierced by the dagger that is love. 
 Your crimson melds a hollow shell. 
 Sinew and bone a temple now stands.
########### The Tears Of Purity ###########
O fire of God, sear my heart and erase the marks of my past/ peace of God, steal all my scars/ restore your promised rest/ since the day of our divorce my voice has known only silence, but Your Spirit rose high/ a fire in the sky brought warmthto my heart/ saved my soul from violence/ and now as we renew our vows night falls on my depression/ eyes filled with light/ i long for Thee betrothed in intercession

########### Seized And Devoured ###########
Rebirth, turmoil among the slaves 
 Cosmic realms far beyond the sun implode 
 We are not of this world 
 Abandoned our home; now we've come to take yours 
 Unleash this wrath on your pitiful people 
 kneel before my minions, as they kneel before me 
 I take the form of a god 
 The mindless follow me 
 The gluttony I find in this filthy waste of life disgusts me 
 Seized and devoured by your loving sun 
 Migration of the slave human pigs 
 No charred remains 
 I take the form of a god 
 The mindless follow me 
 Cosmic realms far beyond the sun implode 
 We are not of this world 
 Abandoned our home; now we've come to take yours 
 Unleash this wrath on your pitiful people 
 Shipped off like cattle, butchered, now you'll see
########### Abducted ###########
Blasphemous man made abomination born 
 Creating something that's never been made before 
 Savior where are you now? 
 Wreaking terror through the sky 
 Hate envelops every soul 
 Your fate no longer in your hands, mind control to the fullest extent, 
 demise of humanity 
 Severed heads overflow as the spree continues 
 Man destroys man, the ultimate killing machine 
 Resistance: a ticket to sure death 
 Słońce zachodzi 
 Death now rules this hated land 
 man-made abomination born 
 Spawned the destruction machine rises 
 Eaten from the inside out 
 Every last worthless piece of fucking shit dead
########### Final Abhorrent Dream ###########
Incineration from within while the mind decays, 
 body taken over by microscopic fiend, control belongs to me, 
 I am your master, I am your god, this earth bows to me, 
 the desire to kill and control, another planet mine, total conquest, 
 empire built upon oppressing domination, 
 this is the only way, an age of torment must begin, 
 all are human and all are same and all must pay, 
 grotesque visions of the future, too powerful to cease control, 
 with loathsome force I strike you down, there can be no rebellion, 
 none will survive these ravaging times with infestation imminent, 
 mechanical drills from within puncturing the feeble shrieking humans, 
 the frontal cortex bursts spilling the contents of the mind, 
 spreading the programmed infestation, automated pestilence, 
 the human minds erode away as all become unthinking, 
 my final abhorrent dream realized, to create a mindless human army 7 billion strong, 
 void of all thought, empty minds worship me, no cognition, they do as I say 
 Incineration from within while the mind decays, 
 body taken over by microscopic fiend, control belongs to me, 
 I am your master, I am your god, this earth bows to me
########### Corpses Thrown Accross The Sky ###########
Impaling anomaly strikes, pierce the vile and depraved, 
 slumped down, succumbing to the mechanical beast not of this world 
 Machine arms grasp intestines, as the human life comes to an end, 
 killed it cannot be, sent to wipe this sphere clean, 
 Implanted seeds beckon a new beginning, a new race has come to rule, 
 forces beyond your comprehension, you may fight but you will die 
 Slowly weakening the insides, paralysis leaves them on their knees, 
 on their knees, begging for their lives, 
 on their knees, begging for their fucking lives, 
 Humans sliced apart, carnage fills the streets, 
 dismantling what is left of humankind, beheaded, corpses thrown across the sky, 
 discarded, chaos and darkness engulfing earth, 
 bodies and loose limbs flowing through the blood red rivers 
 Machine arms grasp intestines, as the human life comes to an end, 
 killed it cannot be, sent to wipe this sphere clean, 
 Implanted seeds beckon a new beginning, a new race has come to rule, 
 forces beyond your comprehension, you may fight but you will die

 succumbing to the mechanical beast not of this
########### Embryonic Anomaly ###########
Fetus removed and slaughtered as she sleeps 
 replaced by embryonic anomaly 
 bred to kill when time comes 
 disguised life among the civilization, isolation spawns hate, 
 lashing out to begin widespread slaughter, planted alien now executes, 
 unstoppable force 
 helpless humans cannot defeat it, 
 the leader of its dominant anti-empyrean race 
 claiming lives with devastating vigor, 
 putrid stench of death rises through the air, havoc, a massacre, 
 extermination in its purest form, 
 genocide of the soon to be forgotten swine of earth, 
 feeding on their carcasses to fuel our killing rampage 
 fetus removed and slaughtered as she sleeps 
 replaced by embryonic anomaly 
 bred to kill when time comes
########### Annihilating The Pure ###########
Decapitate 
 Feast on your flesh 
 Now feel my blade, you are no longer whole, 
 ripped apart, you are no longer whole 
 You took your life for granted, now I'll take it away, mutilate 
 Tearing away at will, I separate skin from bone 
 But I will not end this because you've fucked me over one too many times 
 Spilling your blood at my leisure fuck you, 
 pissing over what is left of your corpse 
 I lacerate your flesh, fuck 
 bodily fluids flow freely as I rip, cut and tear, 
 repetition of killing, genocide of the human race, 
 my final mutation has come, you face the darkness, 
 annihilating the pure to dominate again 
 take back this ancient planet, this land belongs to me 
 Your earth, a desolate shadow of its former state 
 Fallen human filth I will show no mercy 
 planet fucked 
 A hole in space, embryonic waste
########### Grinding Of Internal Organs ###########
From the bowels of the earth they will arise, I summon your dead to work for me 
 to raise an army unlike one's ever seen, ancestral beings wipe out this failed race, 
 fertile earth and water for the starved true creators, once extinguished but brought forth to kill another day 
 oppressive rule returns to transcend the weak foundations of man, 
 awakening the undead, immortal servants risen only to eliminate, 
 sinking rotting teeth, screams of the frail as they get devoured 
 carrion corpses running wild, there is no salvation 
 grinding of internal organs creates a pleasurable sound 
 From the bowels of the earth they will arise, I summon your dead to work for me 
 to raise an army unlike one's ever seen, ancestral beings wipe out this failed race, 
 fertile earth and water for the starved true 
 creators, once extinguished but brought forth to kill another day 
 torn apart by the mutated deceased, ripping you apart as your stumps bleed eternally 
 I live on even as your flesh deteriorates, spreading myself among the 
 oblivious populous, infecting everything around with my viral antigene 
 Enlarging my army of the ravenous upon you.

 We will no leave until the deed is done 
 Our true form finally revealed 
 Panic ensues accept us as your new overlords 
 Anxiously awaiting we ingest human life forces

 Exhausting Earth's resources, watching it disintegrate behind us

########### Galactic Cleansing ###########
Kill every human on this Earth 
 We have been complacent for far too long, time is up 
 Ancient man considered us their masters 
 Refuse to comply you will meet your end 
 Humans can't fathom our animosity 
 Jaw clasp to delicate limbs, blood fills the mouth 
 The entrails of those harvested marks the dawn of a new galactic cleansing 
 We are the end of the organism, the embodiment of all torment 
 We are what a black whole fears, an ancient adversary that's awoken 
 Warp the mind, deranged thoughts, erratic massacre begins 
 An army genetically engineered with one goal in mind 
 Lay waste to the filth the resides here, a genocidal epidemic 
 Introduced, families fragmented before their very eyes

Shards of scorched flesh descend from the skies 
 Those who attempt to flee are instantly vaporized 
 We will breed with your kind, constantly creating a new form of killer 
 Our minions impose the submission of less significant souls 
 They must pay their dues with the proper sacrifice 
 Isolate the populace, begin total obliteration of this atrocity of nature 
 Behold Earth, the epitome of life 
 Once flourishing now a nuisance in our eyes 
 Carelessly slaughtering all, dismembered bodies free floating 
 Helpless screams to stop, music to our fucking ears

Inducing fear 
 Into prosaic minds that do now believe in me 
 Spewing forth acidic fluids 
 Gruesome blisters rupture 
 Beneath the epidermis lies, Labyrinths of organs ripping apart 
 Returned to the proper home 
 As their corpses putrefy 
 Crumbling human forms 
 We extract, and feast upon their bowels

This is the path you will be subject to follow 
 Burrowing into the mind, I ever approach to eviscerate such filth 
 Manifesting beneath skin to dwell within luscious organs 
 Rewriting the human code 
 Recreate the era of an ancient civilization 
 All of life, these merciless forms consume your world

 You are helpless in the eyes of the unknown

 As our crafts descend upon your terrain 
 Upon your terrain 
 Abducting everything in sight 
 Failure to succumb to my being, we will infest your soul 
 Extract the life 
 Reanimate these corpses to wage war on those who disobey 
 Faces are imploding, blood vessels are exploding 
 All you can see is death in their eyes 
 Enigmatic forms consume their hearts 
 Craving, anxiously awaiting the next chance there is to feast 
 We have claimed this race 
 The abomination of evil has arrived 
 And thus, they perish 
 Winds carry what has transpired to the ears of those enslaved 
 Let this storm of apocalyptic chaos rain over your insignificant home 
 Publicly executed for the people who are left to observe 
 Dispersed throughout the plain creating mountains of corpses 
 An experiment your lives have become 
 The extinction of the human scum is now 
 Run

Communication disrupted, scramble to the streets now fleeing like cowards 
 Mortals encased by an unworldly bacterium

 Families abducted, anatomy examined from the core 
 Strategically peeling all the arteries 
 Observing the effects deliberately

 Observing the effects deliberately

 To quench the thirst that provoked this deadly encounter 
 A horrific display of carnage

 This species is doomed, there is no hope for the future 
 This species is doomed, there is no hope for the... 
 Mankind has failed for the last time 
 Years of negligence accountable for it's demise 
 The chance to wake up, now is lost forever 
 Forever 
 Undeserving creatures scramble to protect their lives from us now 
 No way to fight all the pain, teeth grinding away 
 We've made our efforts to condone 
 The blueprint of the human body manipulated to suffer 
 Staring at the heavens for hope, only to see their final fate 
 Hysterical cries are heard as the hole of eternal darkness draws near 
 Ultra terrestrials flooding the sky 
 Inferior minds can no longer comprehend 
 The reality, the vision of the Hyperforms has been revealed 
 Perspective will never be the same 
 There is no escape from extinction 
 Our universe now a cosmic tundra 
 A cold wasteland remains, void of all fucking life 
 Void of all life

 Not a single thing more, for the seekers of peace will only find it in death 
 Simple minded shit and piss filled sacks of meat and blood 
 Not designed for rebellion, but the perfect specimen to experience pain 
 What do you hope to prove? Other than the fact your species deserves a permanent fucking extinction 
 Unlike other life forms, humans are worthless 
 Make way for my offspring of darkness 
 I will create a kingdom in my image 
 But to rebuild, one must first destroy 
 Your destruction will be instantaneous 
 Mindless psyche, controlled and channeled through a series of religious tactics 
 Futile humans. Delicate, empty, vessels of emotion
########### Desolate Paradise ###########
The worship of a false deity has reached it's end. 
 Civilization has run amok. Completely devoid of all mercy. The harbinger. 
 An insatiable urge to destroy the planet, even one as pathetic as earth. Vengeance is the most refreshing. 
 Fingernails split as you try to pry my hand from your throat [2x] 
 With my ascension, my new dynasty will be devised. It has begun, awaken from your slumber. 
 Awaken. 
 Plant the weapon in the galactic nucleus. Disorganized, disordered planet. The energy increased with each final dying star [2x] 
 I am a creature of malice and affliction. History shall at last repeat itself once more. Through me you will enter your own desolate paradise. I am destruction in it's most elegant form. 
 Break from the core. Shatter the crust. Claimed these souls as my mindless drones.
########### Lalassu Xul ###########
The ancient battalion birthed in the same universe surges through the extent of the cosmos. Harness the elementary particles, the power of a black hole is at our disposal. 
 Take aim at this sphere. Gravitational waves surround the world, as we watch it decay into oblivion. Atoms turn to dust. The body cells rupture. 
 An unsettling occurrence to lay sight to. Remnants of our existence, scattered through time and space. 
 Consumed, ensnared, mute of all fucking light. Lugal.zu.i.men. Lalassu Xul [2x] I am your king. The Evil Spectre.

 Take aim at this sphere. Gravitational waves surround the world, as we watch it decay into oblivion. Atoms turn to dust. The body cells rupture. 
 The god of death has arrived to smash the larva that crawl on this land. Squirm, earthlings. This is all that you can do [2x] 
 For I have come here because of each one of you. I have planted my seed in your mother Earth, to to watch the roots of death finally flourish once again. 
 Consumed, ensnared, mute of all fucking light.
########### Infused ###########
Mankind has become nothing but a worthless, feeble creation. For centuries, I have awaited to begin my ultimate emancipation. 
 Perfect specimen t infuse itself with the human's weak decrepit life force. Nourished by cretin's blood, now part of mortal genetic code. These foul earthlings shall feel what suffering truly means. 
 A nefarious machine, not to feel remorse, not to feel fear, not to feel pity. 
 These entities shall be condemned into the endless cosmic void. 
 Mankind has become nothing but a worthless, feeble creation. For centuries, I have awaited to begin my ultimate emancipation. 
 Intestines push forth and fall prey to my offspring. Autolysis has begun to set in [2x] 
 The skin decomposes while the insides purge out. My army is beginning to take it's final shape 
 Take it's final shape
########### Natural Selection ###########
The fabric of our mortal consciousness slowly deteriorates. The masses have returned to a state of primal action. Sit back, and watch as this material realm decays to a pile of bubbling flesh and bone. 
 Microbial proliferation, from the frothy tissues, stings the the nostrils of the humans thinking they have survived. An utterly terrifying demonstration of natural selection [2x] 
 They're dismantling delicate limbs at a molecular level. Their fleshy tissues begin to diffuse, as the maggots slowly eat the eyes. 
 Their numbers have grown and humans are left alone to wait for the day that the king will claim this decayed throne, to take this crown of thorns as my own. [4x] 
 The fabric of our mortal consciousness slowly deteriorates. The masses have returned to a state of primal action. Sit back, and watch as this material realm decays to a pile of bubbling flesh and bone.
########### Beckon ###########
We have brought down the cracked, and pitted, holy gates. Etch these words into your skull, I am the king of kings and lay claim to this universe. 
 Everything will die by the hands of your master. Call upon gods and beg them for your salvation. 
 We have brought down the cracked, and pitted, holy gates. Etch these words into your skull, I am the king of kings and lay claim to this universe. 
 Locked away in total darkness for the rest of eternity. Silence the screams that echo through the centuries. 
 Speak of the devil and so he shall appear. I beckon that he may, so that I can slit him ear to ear. 
 Conserve your last breath and let my blade do the talking. Embrace the horror of our everlasting presence. Such inferior species shall forever feel the clench of our ruthless, unrelenting grasp. And we shall put these fucking souls to rest. This insignificant dimension is doomed.
########### Godless Times ###########
I have come to cast these unprofitable souls into a land of eternal darkness. 
 They will join their angels and demons in a life of weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
 Burn their flesh to a crisp, and let the flakes fall down for my children. 
 The smoke will ascend to the divine one's realm, where I will meet him with his second fucking death. 
 Bind him by his hand and foot, not even he can escape the stench of death. 
 I have strung him up and bled him dry, to sip his life force from the holy grail. 
 These are now godless times, and you are all fucked. 
 For as he resurrects, I shall strike him down again. 
 [2x] 
 Purge the resources until the core crumbles. 
 This is not holy war, just extermination. 
 [2x] 
 Make way for your godless engineer. 
 Fertilize the land with the blood of the righteous ones.
########### Unsympathetic Intellect ###########
The devil himself is stricken with fear. Make him my minion. The apex predator has arrived. 
 Hell is empty, for these demons and dimension will fucking disintegrate in the glory of my preeminent power. The one that you all call God will find himself on the brink of my abysmal new realm. Reclaim our home. 
 From his eyes will gush the birth of a new hierarchy. A new planet, stripped of all reason. 
 Unsympathetic intellect gazes upon this swarm of mortals in revulsion. Blessed are the dead who's cadavers have perished by our hand. For you will join your fictitious deity. For you will join them all

What a perverse colony you all have become. Insolent scum, ungrateful of the life we have given you. We are the Alpha, we are the Omega, we are here to eviscerate all. A fucking disgrace to your maker. A celestial presence, not seen by imperfect scum. 
 Bare witness to the incomprehensible, skies are stained black with the ashes of billions. Landscapes are covered with the remains of charred hominids. The latest extinct precursor of man. 
 We have wiped the globe clean of every civilization since the dawn of time. We are virtually unstoppable.

 Hide your face with your hands 
 One last breath 
 Hold it in

########### Teritorium ###########
To slova Orion ještě jednou ne naposled, 
 To slova bez pardonu originální slovosled, 
 Přímo hleď, sladkej jak med, 
 Chladnej jak led, už pár let, 
 Don Seladon na pohled. 
 Co bylo drív to už neni teď, 
 Co je teď do zejtra přehradí vysoká zeď, 
 Co bude dál, na co se ptal, 
 Nejeden král, špatně rozhodnul dostal a svou bitvu prohrál, 
 Jak sedláky u Chlumce, ratata, rozsekal, 
 Zde seká, Orion na každej sál, 
 ? zaostal, co si čekal nedostal, 
 Já sem ti to nejlepší dal, díky bože za ten dar, 
 Mužem mě mít rád, mužeš mě nenavidět, 
 Mužeš ze mě srát, nemusíš se za to stydět, 
 Můžeš o mě psát, co si moh někde slyšet, 
 Ikdyž mě neznáš, brzo poznáš co nevidět, 
 Můj trumfem - mý album - neni první ani poslední, 
 Řekni svejm felům, že Orion je komerční, 
 Házej na mě špínu nebo mi dej lásku svou, když na koncertě se mnou zařveš jou-jou. 
 Sem kontroverzní, možná i perverzní, 
 Nemám pro nudný MC's co si myslí, že to mízí, 
 Založili na tom kariéru svou - pofiderní, 
 Uvidíme, za jak dlouho se to teda změní, 
 Jdem za svou masou, za svym idolem, 
 Chceš se prosadit, je tu místo, tak si ho kurva vem, 
 Vyšlap si vlastní cestu, udělej svý publikum, 
 Máš na to, nebo co, tak si stěžuj buzikum, 
 Stojim vzpříma, žiju jako číslo jedna, 
 Dva-tři-čtyři-pět, od základů jsem se učil dělat rap, 
 Co mám teď, nešlo samo hned, 
 Probděný hodiny, popsanej papír, fet, 
 Rap pro rap, slovo dalo slovo, 
 Nechci měnit svět, jen přilejvat olovo, 
 S deskou novou, znova a nanovo, 
 Vítej, Teritorium Orionovo, 
 Jak supernova krají cestu noční oblohou, 
 Spaluje energii do letu tvrdě vloženou, 
 I já si beru co mi patří mojí zásluhou, 
 Už nechoď promotére za mnou, za tou charitou. 
 Rap pro rap, slovo dalo slovo, 
 Nechci měnit svět, jen přilejvat olovo, 
 S deskou novou, znova a nanovo, 
 Vitej, vítej, Teritorium Orionovo.

Orion : Přijíždím ve svým novým fáru chci zbalit holky na svou káru mam nový kola všechny ty gumy jsou ve féru a ty tlumiče ah péruj péruj. Mám sice řidiče co nejede bez kéru ale vozí mně a já můžu pít na sekeru. Pak vyrazit zastavit něco v bazaru objet kluby, restaurace a pár barú. Snad se mi to zdaří už konečne rvu se zatím srdečně statečně, ale kždá holha když mně vydí nic nezačne, uhne pohledem zmizí v šatně. Rychle, značně dala to na jevo jednoznačně, že dnešní večer nedopadne pro mně opět senzačne. Jako chudáček se znám a nevěřím si propadám bezmoci není mi pomoci. Proč nemám to co chci jak ostatní borci. Už nechci bejt sám ve dne i v noci 
 Čistychov : Dneska boli všetci úspešní, iba ja zase né, všetci majú dorbé zážitky iba ja zase zlé, že som si ešte nezajebal, každá baba vlastne vie snažím sa to zmeniť ale ale ale daj si facku! Lebo nových bojím sa ja a malé boja mňa sa a u tých čo ma poznajú je sex so mnou pasé zasa. Dvadsať rokov passé jasne, nikdy nie moc krásne a niekedy zase značne nemorálne, no aj tak som ho žiadne ešte nedal perorálne. Moje ego sexuálne je malé a netrúfalé. Nepojebem ani to čoho radšej sa aj ten trápny jebo vzdá len. Ikeď už aj kľakne, rozopne gate, cukne povie tak nie tvoj vták nie a za desať minút sa s ňou môj kamoš v izbe zamkne, fakt že tak je. Pretvárky a hranie, mňa ojebávanie pre nejebanie tam dole zas on sám je bez dám je. Cítim bezprávie, prečo on hej, prečo ten hej, prečo ty hej a prečo ja nie. 
 Tina (ref.) : Veď s tebou pláva ako malá ryba v mori slov, skutočnosť bez skutkov tak bezvýznamná. Neporovnávaj ma s každou ou ou ou ooo. Som najlepšie čo môžeš mať ty mi fakt nemáš čo dať. Veď s tebou pláva ako malá ryba v mori slov, skutočnosť bez skutkov tak bezvýznamná. Chceš sa hrať a nevieš jak nechaj tak nie si chlap ak máš skrat je to lepšie radšej vzdať. 
 Orion : Jednou v Marseille na nadherné dovolené jel sem na měsíc s cílem jíst ovoce zakázané. Tolik překrásnejch v jednom měste nevídané co u nás doma nemáme to bude za živa ne. A omyl mluvím do ní: ,,Ale ale excusez-moi parlez-vous anglais?" A ona řekla : Jo co bys chtel ty vole, nezbalíš nic ani doma a tady už teprv ne. Jestli ti to brzo nedojde nic t sím neudeláš tak ti kokot upadne." Co má se stát to se stane.Snad abych šel podepsat smlouvu se Satanem. Tak to ne, říká mi ten nahoře spamatuj se a nebuď jak kuře na dvoře, ale jsem to já kdo to dycky zvoře a dnes opět zabouchla mi za dveře. 
 Čistychov : Pamätám si ešte časy školy, že som pod lavicou kukal učiteľke medzi nohy roky. Dievčatá, ktoré po telesnej v sprche holé boli (Orion :,,hmm díval ses jim na cokoliv?") hej! 
 Pre ten pocit v gatiach som bol ochotný skočiť, no teraz po rokoch s tým kokotom viem furt len močiť. Z desiatich opýtaných odmietne ma desať dievčat. Všetkým cicka stúpa prečo mne má klesať. Veď centimetrov nemám desať, no aj tak nemám kde stáť ešte ani nezačal som a už mám prestať? Prehrať ,presrať, šancu posrať, zmeškať či zrobiť sa jak žebrák pre štát. Chodiť jebať za kurvami zo dna nevstať. Podám si ja inzerát ešte dnes snáď, či nechcete mňa. Vy svine skúste na mňa tie hovná nesrať a prestať trestať.

Magmazél sakrblé, no i když dám si cuba libré třeba tři kýble. V baru je dost obejít všechny bude zle, ale známe se, všechno se dá když se chce. Mít dobrý záminky je základ každý akce.

2005 Teritorium 2 
 Vorel, Orion 
 Buchty čekaj, čekaj na nás.. 
 Pamatuju jak na mým oblíbeným baru 
 Koupil jsem si akorát kytaru v bazaru 
 Zahrál cigánský G a vyndal škváru 
 Proběh oční kontakt s kočkou ze sálu 
 Přišla ke mně, dlouhý nohy už od země 
 Říkám, co piješ, platím já, je to na mě 
 Vona že prej si to co já ráda dá 
 Tak si dáváme oba dva Bílýho medvěda 
 Už ani nevím, ten drink, co to asi je 
 Jestli to někdo ví, ať mi to laskavě řekne 
 Vrátím se do baru a řeknu: Hele, barmane 
 Příště mi nedávej, co máš za pití ve slevě 
 Strhla se pitka, no a ještě aby ne 
 Ta slečinka držela krok náramně 
 Dlouho jsem takovou nepotkal, jemine 
 Divoký hříšný tanec, opravdu zábavné 
 Táhli jsme to tam, kam až jsme se dotáhli 
 Po celým městě v baru v každým muziku hráli 
 ?** V Chapeau, v Boombai, Blue Lightu 1 bombej **? 
 ?** US Bomben i Bombeng, haló, drožka, ok? **? 
 V taxíku mě líbej, ty řiď nekoukej 
 Máš rito, tak na to šlápni, dělej, dělej, dělej 
 Začíná to dobře, jsem nažhavenej celej 
 Ona je rozjetá a bude dobrá noc prej, hej 
 Ref: Past je připravená 
 Joj, tak kdo se chytí? 
 Jen na tebe tu čeká 
 A kluci už letí 
 Past je připravená 
 Joj, tak kdo se chytí? 
 Jen na tebe tu čeká 
 A kluci už letí 
 Noc byla skvělá, nádherná, sladká 
 Všechny polohy, do pusy, pičky, čubka 
 Čísel deset, škoda, že není fotka 
 Ráno snídaně: Ahoj, já jsem Jitka 
 Kdo moh tušit, že se to takhle spacká? 
 Volá mi za tejden, že sprcka prackla 
 A že mě miluje a chce si nechat prcka 
 Cože? To je pořádná facka 
 Že bych měl vědět, že už má dvě děcka 
 A já jsem teďka pro ni naděje všecka 
 Nemůžou přece vyrůstat bez otěcka 
 Musím se ženit, tak to je pecka 
 Vsadím se s váma, že je nás takovejch víc 
 Co se padli do pasti a ted už se nedá dělat nic 
 Tak pozor na to, ať neskončíte jako já 
 Tři děti na krku a jedna ženská šílená 
 Musel jsem prodat i tu svou kytaru 
 Cigánský G už si nikdy nezahraju v baru 
 Pak to může skončit takhle a ne náhodou 
 Je to hned, raz dva, když jsi pod parou 
 2x ref: Past je připravená 
 Joj, tak kdo se chytí? 
 Jen na tebe tu čeká 
 A kluci už letí 
 Past je připravená

 Lži a klamy, ojebávání a klamání 
 Je na denním pořádku, tak už to všem přijde normální 
 Nikdo se neobává, nebrání 
 Nepřipadáš si abnormální když hájíš morální chování 
 Ale co to vlastně je, v týhle době? 
 Kdo věří v Boha a kdo myslíš, že věří tobě? 
 Z toho už se snad nikdo neobrací v hrobě 
 Všichni rezignovali ve vlastní osobě 
 Jsi poctivej - cože, co je to za blbce? 
 Cože? Co si myslíš, že získáš, vole? 
 Se podívej, nic nemáš, idiote! 
 Prej pravda vítězí nad lží a nenávistí 
 Tomu málokdo věří, pesimisti 
 Kdo zkurvil tuhle zemi? Komunisti.. 
 A kdo ji kurví teď? My sami 
 Je na každým z nás udělat změnu 
 Teď máme v rukách možnost a má to cenu 
 Nechci se chovat bez zájmu, jako emu 
 Nestrkám hlavu do písku, ale to, co chci, si vemu 
 Chovej se k ostatním jak k sobě samému 
 Proč stále ojebávat se ziskem ve jménu 
 Nebudu suportovat tuhle doménu 
 Štěstí mi nepřinese, ale spíš víc problémů

 Děláš kariéru nebo bariéru 
 Jsi otrok na svobodě a máš svou voliéru 
 Kolem sebe postavenou jak sloupy belvederu 
 Cejtíš se lepší, jsi něco víc, na to ti... 
 Není všechno zlato, co se třpytí 
 Všechno se nedá koupit, nedá se svítit 
 Kolik stojí láska a kolik stojí štěstí? 
 Jdeš za tím celej život nebo dostaneš pěstí 
 Kolik ti dala páska, kolik stojí tvoje žena? 
 Vzala si tě kvůli prachům, aby život měla ulehčen a 
 Děláš to pro ní, zatím tě ojebává ona 
 Nevíš o ničem, makáš od večera do rána 
 Dobrý auta, baráky, cetky, zlato 
 Každej je chce mít, každej dělá všechno pro to 
 Je ale smutný se kvůli tomu ojebávat 
 Bylo dost falše, klamů, nač o to zakopávat 
 Tak skončili jsme jasná zpráva 
 Čechy 2005 a všichni furt nadávaj 
 Olympijský vítězové vyhrávaj 
 Zlatý český ručičky na mě všude mávaj 
 Nejlepší pivo, nejlepší baby na světě 
 Co Čech, to muzikant - spíš muzikál v operetě 
 Proč mám slyšet tydle sračky proklatě 
 Dělám rap - muzika, co probere tě 
 Nemíním poslouchat už tuny populáru 
 Píčoviny, Superstar a country kytaru 
 Za tohle solej zmrdi umělcům škváru 
 Je tu Buranov, volám po změně, ne po staru

Čas nezastavíš, do nekonečna nelze i pro rapera se jednou zavřou dveře, co si myslíš? že v padesáti budě někdo na pódiu rapovat ráno do pěti, pro děti. Všechno má svuj čas i svou dobu, životnost je omezená (?) do hrobu, najdi si svůj styl a svou podobu nebo se na to radši vyser a věnuj se jinýmu jobu.

Tak se nespoléhej na nikoho jen na sebe, ať využiješ talent jestli nějakej máš ty vole, měl bys situaci dobře rozmyslet jinak padej vodsať a to tak že kurva hned. Pupustil ses do rapování, dobrá, tak ale ať to vypadá jak vypadat to má, nestačí jen prázdný slova, somrák, musíš do toho vložit všechno co se dá. 
 Chceš po sobě něco zanechat, a máš co říct, nebo budeš jen plácat blabla a víc už nic.

########### Glad All Over ###########
Ain't no doubt about it, this must be love 
 One little kiss from you and I feel glad all over 
 Oh baby, hot-dang-dilly, it's so silly but I'm glad all over 
 I got goose pimples baby, 'cause it feels so good 
 When you cuttle me like you do and I feel glad all over 
 Oh mercy, I'm a real cool pappy and I'm happy

I remember all my life 
 Raining down as cold as ice 
 A shadow of a man 
 A face through a window 
 Crying in the night 
 The night goes into 
 Morning, just another day 
 Happy people pass my way 
 Looking in their eyes 
 I see a memory 
 I never realized 
 How happy you made me, oh Mandy 
 Well you came and you gave without taking 
 And I sent you away, oh Mandy 
 And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking 
 And I need you today, oh Mandy 
 I'm standing on the edge of time 
 Walked away when love was mine 
 Caught up in a world of uphill climbing 
 The tears are in my eyes 
 And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy 
 Well you came and you gave without taking 
 And I sent you away, oh Mandy 
 And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking 
 And I need you today, oh Mandy 
 Yesterday's a dream 
 Now I face the morning 
 Crying on the breeze 
 The pain is calling, oh Mandy 
 Well you came and you gave without taking 
 And I sent you away, oh Mandy 
 And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking 
 And I need you today, oh Mandy 
 Well you came and you gave without taking 
 And I sent you away, oh Mandy 
 And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking 
 And I need you today, oh Mandy

########### Mirages ###########
If it’s true that blood is thicker than water, 
 Your veins must be an ocean of treachery. 
 White lies, no, they mean nothing to me, 
 As you coax me into false fraternity. 
 What are you trying to prove? 
 And who are you trying to fool? 
 What are you trying to prove? 
 And who are you trying to fool? 
 If I had time to wipe the dirt off my eyes, 
 I wouldn’t have walked so blindly. 
 Your love and care 
 Was what you wore, a mask you wear. 
 I see your shade, 
 I hear your voice, 
 I walk the sand with no choice 
 To find the love you showed me 
 To find the love you owe me. 
 And one day, I won’t turn back, 
 Burn all your bridges, and bury the past. 
 You’re wasting time and you’re wasting mine. 
 You have left me behind. 
 Count all of your mistakes on the fingers 
 You have left, you thief. 
 As I’ll cut everyone off for all the things 
 You tried to take from me. 
 I am a mirage; you can't feel the 
 Water rushing down your throat 
 When your lungs Are filled 
 With the lies you spoke. 
 In a world of my enemies, 
 I stand alone. 
 In a world of my enemies, I stand alone. 
 Never fearing what the future has in store. 
 If the sand swallows me, I’ll pull you under. 
 Blood will always outweigh water.

Shapes and objects start to melt into 
 A kaleidoscope; in gray scale 
 No matter how tired I may be 
 My mind, it is constantly 
 Darting into the depth 
 Of my imagination 
 Shapes and objects start to melt into 
 A kaleidoscope 
 Prolonging this strange state 
 Of self reflection 
 A state that soon will be forgotten 
 As I drift away
########### Smashing ###########
How could you lie right between your teeth? 
 Contempt of my life, I now resent 
 Everything you are, and why you left 
 I will never forgive you 
 You're nothing special, 
 So ordinary 
 Used to value your opinion 
 Now you're too used up to mention 
 The current pulls me under 
 Your eyes will watch me fade 
 You lie through your intentions 
 I'll never be the same 
 You kill me with your silence 
 I pushed you far away 
 So I'll just disappear now 
 And hope it's just a dream 
 You made me close my mind 
 Turned it to a shelter 
 Covered in vines 
 You made me close my mind 
 Turned it to a shelter 
 Covered in vines 
 Hope it will haunt you! 
 All my stupid friends 
 Think this will pass me 
 Tell me to move on 
 Pain everlasting 
 Trying to succeed 
 Hoping I can fight through 
 All of my regretful thoughts 
 Wish I never met you 
 Through the past I wish I could 
 Go back and just deny you 
 So tell me why, don't tell me lies 
 Just tell me why, tell me why you didn't even try 
 The current pulls me under 
 Your eyes will watch me fade 
 You lie through your intentions 
 I'll never be the same 
 You kill me with your silence 
 I pushed you far away 
 So I'll just disappear now 
 And hope it's just a dream 
 No, I won't give in 
 I will not give in
########### Hyperion ###########
And you taught me what I was truly born for. 
 I would’ve never thought I’d come this far. 
 I knew that this could be something more 
 I looked through the glass at the man in the mirror, 
 and looked deeply at the face we share. 
 His eyes are wrought by the weight of restless nights, 
 Trepidation keeps haunting his mind. 
 Is there a way I can silence his qualms? 
 Is there a way I can silence my qualms? 
 I'm so scared to lose my humility 
 All my life, I’ve been fed by complacency. 
 Swallowing my words has only purged my life, 
 Until you came and showed me the light. 
 Removed the clouds in a world so dark 
 I am now a grain of hope 
 On a shore of black sand and rocks. 
 The road before me has no path, 
 Should I risk walking on unmarked lands? 
 Illuminate the way 
 Show me colors in grey 
 I can’t feel the ground beneath my feet 
 The water’s rising, and I’m almost neck deep 
 Shine the hope that is left 
 Inside of me 
 And I never thought I’d change, 
 But I never want to stay the same. 
 Who I am today refuses to be afraid. 
 I won’t let my past define me, 
 But I’ll always remember my history. 
 This hope that you’ve given me 
 Gave me the strength to keep fighting. 
 This is my conviction, and I’ll say it loud 
 I knew that I would make proud. 
 Even though I was born in a world of hate, 
 I followed my dreams and adopted music. 
 Fostering this passion with every note I play 
 Is a love that they’ll never take away. 
 They fake their fate because they are blind. 
 I don’t bother with them; they’ll fade with time. 
 Shine lights 
 Polaris guide me 
 Thank you for all you've given me
########### Blank Face ###########
I'm terrified 
 Of becoming 
 Another blank face 
 Staring in 
 The face of my wristwatch 
 Watching time slip away 
 Hands spinning, dragging me with them 
 False progression, marked by this mechanical ticking 
 Dragging me with them 
 Mechanical ticking 
 As I lethargically drag my feet across this planets surface 
 I feel the gears rattle inside of my head, they never slow down 
 This device will not govern how I live my life, I'm trying I swear 
 To take in every brief moment that I am here, before I am gone
########### False Fathers ###########
I've been praying for far too long 
 To see both of my father’s dissolve 
 Ones real and the others an impostor 
 But both seem as absent as the other 
 One is the man I wanted to become 
 The other is composed of living scum 
 They both have their ways to torment me 
 While I search for my false sense of sanity 
 So now I ingest this insecticide 
 To try to eradicate all of these butterflies 
 That keep struggling to arise 
 Straight out the fucking depths of my insides 
 It’s time for me to break this oppressive mold 
 To finally say this shit that I've never told 
 To blame all your mistakes on a 14-year-old 
 Was it me who put that coke up your nose 
 How does a man find himself if he never had a mentor? 
 Cast your self to the side, for a life of drugs and whores 
 You lost me 
 You lost me 
 You lost me 
 You lost me 
 Lost a son 
 Lost a son 
 Lost a son 
 Lost a son
########### Invertebrate ###########
Awaken from this dreary state 
 Trying to collect these past few weeks 
 Where nothing seems to go my way 
 (Where nothing seems to go my way) 
 Lost in the simple complication of things 
 I fold, I crumble, and drop to my knees 
 Only to catch a glimpse of a life so bleak 
 So now I fester in a pool of remorse 
 To see how far my life has gone off course 
 I guess I'll need help from a mental nurse 
 Before I'm carried out in the back of a hearse 
 Coming so close to purity 
 To rid my life of this putridity 
 Then once again these demeaning thoughts 
 (These are demeaning thoughts) 
 Are back in my head 
 Oppressing and decreasing my morale 
 Seeking refuge in empty bottles 
 And clouding my goals in smoke 
 (And clouding my goals in smoke) 
 Is this all I really have to my name? 
 Is being so fucked up I don't remember the days 
 And all my friends start to fade away 
 Something has to change 
 Something has got to fucking change 
 I'm not trying to push the blame 
 But it's in my genes, even on both sides of the family 
 A whole faction of junkies and fakes 
 I guess I'm tired of all this shit piled up on my plate 
 Just an invertebrate 
 So I guess I'll just put a fucking slug into my face 
 Slug into my face
########### Draw The Line ###########
How does it feel now? 
 How does it feel inside? 
 No hope for tomorrow 
 I trusted you 
 And I lost everything 
 You point the finger 
 You love control 
 You're so afraid 
 (You're so afraid) 
 To let go of this 
 In between it all made sense 
 Go a head and try 
 You point the finger 
 You want to leave 
 But you're afraid 
 Someone believed in me 
 In between it all made sense 
 Buried in the lies 
 I gave my all for this 
 You gave me nothing inside 
 Everything 
 Is about to change 
 Draw the lines in the sand 
 Make me whole over again 
 Draw the lines in the sand 
 Make me whole over again 
 You point the finger 
 Cast doubt with lies 
 You build me up 
 (You build me up) 
 Just to watch me drown inside 
 Cold air catches up 
 And there's no place to hide 
 This is the curse of 
 The martyr and the angel 
 Never once has he ever lead you astray 
 I will never lead you astray 
 The truth is in your lies 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 And you'll stumble all over your words 
 In the end you'll get what you deserve 
 And ill wait for the day you get burned 
 Leave you hanging on my every word of this 
 'Til its all gone, 'til it's all left behind 
 And you'll stumble all over your words 
 In the end you'll get what you deserve
########### Abyssal Plain ###########
So let me guess, you had the best intentions 
 But there's something you forgot to mention 
 You broke my soul for some fucking attention 
 And now I'm stranded in this hole that I'm left in 
 (This is just a glimpse into a dead mans soul) 
 I'm still trying to revive my psyche 
 From all these past pains that you put on me 
 All my life been labeled as an anomaly 
 I'm still trying to revive my psyche 
 From all these past pains that you put on me 
 All my life been labeled as an anomaly 
 The skeletons in my closet are in my mind 
 Now I sink beneath the bones I thought I left behind 
 The skeletons in my closet came out to play 
 They just sing me to sleep while I dig my own grave 
 I want every part of you stripped from my name 
 Why don’t you just sink 
 Forced my mind to the depths of the abyssal plains 
 Descend with me to the epitome of my own demise 
 (Of my own demise) 
 Pretend with me that this smile is just a disguise 
 (Just a disguise) 
 This is as far as your delusional world goes 
 Splitting all your tendons only shows my backbone 
 Try to force these bonds but nothing will ever hold 
 So put these vile thoughts into actions of hate 
 (Hate) 
 Sever the man who only shits on your faith 
 I want every part of you stripped from my name 
 Why don’t you just sink 
 Forced my mind to the depths of the abyssal plains 
 Come here bitch, lets go for a walk with blade 
 Oh wait, not across the street, lets go down the lane 
 So here I am deeper in this mental case 
 Found these snazzy pair of shoes, they're made of concrete 
 I want no functions forming from your brain 
 And your body be as cold as a slab of slate 
 'Cause the only place I'll ever know as home is at the bottom of the fucking lake 
 So now I sink 
 To the bottom of the lake 
 My lungs fill with water 
 With every breath that I take 
 I'm staring up 
 I see the silhouette of death 
 It flickers closer 
 Until I reach the depths

########### Black Circle ###########
Hear the needle touch 
 Joy fills my heart when the 
 Black circle starts to spin 
 See how proud it stands 
 An old faded cover tells 
 Stories from glorious days 
 Hear the circle sing 
 The genuine sound 
 Bring back memories 
 From forgotten times 
 I know their time is over 
 Their place on the throne is gone 
 They won't reach another level 
 But they're always staying alive 
 Size is evident 
 Pictures of heroes on covers 
 You're seeing them clearly 
 I bleed for this passion 
 Thunder delivered! 
 It's far beyond borders I know 
 Hear the circle sing 
 The genuine sound 
 Brings back memories 
 From the forgotten times 
 Atmosphere so great 
 Strikes the ground 
 Though their time is lost 
 They're never gonna die
########### Bleeding ###########
I'm going through changes 
 But I felt the same way a long time ago 
 It's this time or never 
 I will make it stronger than ever before 
 Some are slaves behind their numbers 
 And some take shelter in their time 
 But I've got no time to spare 
 Bleeding... I kill myself to stay alive 
 Bleeding... out the poison in my veins 
 Bleeding... I kill myself to stay alive 
 Bleeding... 
 You're free to speak 
 Every word that may come to your mind 
 But I just don't care 
 Cause I'm not another invented disease 
 Many men were here before me 
 But I don't need to follow them 
 And I always stand in the end 
 I will carry on my way I won't follow any rules 
 And if the wind will catch our sails I won't be the one to complain 
 And I won't take any blame for following an easy ride 
 Cause I've been down this road before when all was a wasteland
########### Break The Chains ###########
Hear the old songs in the night 
 With words you weren't allowed to hear 
 See pride returning to their faces 
 They're dancing their forbidden dance 
 To the sound of the drum 
 Beating feet to the ground 
 And each step is another nearer the end 
 They will change the world 
 When their voice will be heard 
 And they know it is time to do it now 
 Break the chains of silence - hear the drums in the night 
 No walls in the world can stop them 
 'Cause they're gonna make them fall 
 The ground is shaking to the sound 
 Of hundred men when morning comes 
 That morning I'll be one of them 
 And show the world who I am 
 If you tell me to wait like you've told me before 
 It will soon be too late
########### Come Back To Me ###########
So hard not to think about it 
 it's every step I take 
 and heaven knows i'm trying 
 but it gets awfully hard 
 when your heart is this broken 
 Visions of ur lovely face 
 As I awake, I have this feeling 
 that you're here and beside me 
 how silly of me, I know 
 all the pain will go away 
 so I say it, here I am again 
 I gotta face another day 
 I'm so tired, I need u once again oh baby 
 How am I suppose to carry on, 
 I find myself singing the same old song 
 If you hear me, have it in ur heart 
 but please come back to me (oh baby) 
 I'll be right here if you need someone 
 If you hold another I'll be moving on 
 As easy as said 
 Just hope that I can see the road 
 Oh how it's been so long 
 It seems a lifetime passed 
 These memories that linger, 
 soon as I think they have gone 
 they only gotten stronger 
 And so I'm getting through a day 
 but every move was made was always you and I together 
 It's hard to believe im lonely 
 Is there gonna be a day 
 I can see the word to make me better 
 I know there has to be a way 
 So if you listen and hear me out girl, baby 
 How am I suppose to carry on, 
 I find myself singing the same old song 
 If you hear me, have it in your heart 
 but please come back to me (oh baby) 
 I'll be right here if you need someone 
 if u hold another one i'll be moving on 
 as easy as said 
 just hope that i can see the road 
 seven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 seven 
 when you hear seven turn it up 
 you're one in a million, 
 dunno how we got so wrong 
 I thought it was so simple then 
 now I know, now I know, how it goes 
 to let it go 
 Can there be a chance for you and I? 
 Before I really make up my mind 
 oh how I miss you 
 I never would diss you 
 I'm speaking it from my heart 
 How am I suppose to carry on, 
 I find myself singing the same old song 
 If you hear me, have it in you heart 
 I'll be right here if you need someone 
 if you hold another I'll be moving on 
 just hope that I can see the road 
 come back to me baby
########### Crying In The Wind ###########
In my own dreams I would live here forever 
 If I could make all I did undone 
 What can I say to those who stood by me 
 Well I can hardly see them again 
 I know it's too late for you to forgive me 
 Though I regret everything I did 
 I feel like I'm screaming but nobody hears me 
 They wouldn't care anyway 
 Was it worth all pain, I'm crying in the wind 
 I must answer myself everyday 
 Was it worth all pain, I'm crying in my sleep 
 And my conscience will never be clear 
 All of a sudden my eyes saw new places 
 Calling me now and I know it's time 
 To reach for tomorrow, and leave all behind me 
 A place so far away from myself 
 I open the gate to a whole new dimension 
 Finding my last call has to be made 
 Never again I'll live by their side 
 Building new strength not to stand in their line 
 I will always remember this day 
 Breaking their limits, no reason to stay 
 I'm leaving the place where I used to belong 
 And finally starting my journey home
########### Darkened Eyes ###########
Never again I'll walk this surface 
 Open your mind lights struck before 
 These eyes I'm finding my way through 
 Darkness and sunlight wherever you'll be 
 There's no need to hide your face 
 I'm gonna spread my wings 
 And let them carry me away 
 I might just lie there for a while 
 And for one moment touch the sky 
 And never see through darkened eyes 
 Never again 
 What can I do, the truth affects me 
 I'm leaving my mind, my final destiny 
 I'm falling asleep and I want you to sit 
 By my side lost in a world 
 Grace my eternity
########### Eternal Conflicts ###########
And the eternal way of the world 
 Seems to be a neverending wheel of confrontations 
 There's always someone to rule the game 
 And taking shares from the ones who can't 
 Defend their landmarks 
 Now the world is still in motion 
 And the shores are open wide 
 There's always someone to fight them one by one 
 To conquer new lands, fulfilling their plans to rule forever 
 I don't think anyone in this world 
 Can be the judge of what is right or wrong in man's behavior 
 So don't come preaching, don't need your truth 
 It seems like conflicts always have been around since dawn of time 
 Still the world is spinning around 
 And the shores are burning bright 
 Time never changes, they're never turning back 
 Convincing new minds 
 That now is the time to rule eternally
########### Face To Face ###########
Don't' tell me now with a smile on your face 
 That you're lost down and out 
 When there was nothing left in me 
 You can't stop fucking with my head 
 Stop fucking with my head 
 My silence you break 
 The smile that you fake (you fake) 
 [Chorus] 
 There's not one thing that you can say to make it right 
 Unless you say "I'm leaving" 
 And if you're not then please tell me why 
 Please tell me why you can't 
 Save face 
 Say it to my face 
 Can I take all the filth in your head 
 All the words that you said (that you said) 
 And throw it away (throw it out) 
 You can't stop fucking with my head 
 Stop fucking with my head 
 My silence you break 
 The smile that you take away 
 [Chorus] 
 That shit you're talkin' don't mean nothing to me anymore 
 Limp dick, you fuck stick let's settle the score 
 Run and hide you know I'll find you anywhere 
 Motherfucker, two faced pirck with hell to pay 
 What's real is real, it's time to step up to the plate again 
 Swing batter-batter, swing batter-batter, swing, 
 What's real is real, it's time to step up to the plate again 
 Swing batter-batter, fucked me for the last time! 
 Just take a swing 
 C'mon you should've taken that swing 
 Just take your swing 
 [Chorus] 
 Swing 
 Just take your sing 
 Fuck you! 
 Just take your swing 
 You can't stop fuckin' with my head 
 Stop fucking with my head
########### Feelings ###########
Trust is growing, words are running 
 Feelings change your points of view 
 Yeah!!! 
 Veins are burning, sweat is falling 
 Faith raises the loyalty 
 Dreams are flowing, liquid feelings 
 Break you!!! 
 Try to mend your previous times, 
 Your dreams are longer than your time 
 Mix your blood with gold and fire 
 And fight out!!! 
 Tunders bursting, wind is burning 
 Mind is turning sensitive 
 Lights spinning, gaseous feelings 
 Break you!!! 
 Try to mend your previous times, 
 Your dreams are longer than your time 
 Mix your blood with gold and fire 
 And fight out!!! 
 Sometimes I feel nothing can help me 
 Sometimes I need to break my routine 
 Someone told me the only solution 
 Fill up your life with... HEAVY METAL!!!!! 
 Veins are burning, weat is falling 
 Faith raises the loyalty 
 Dreams are flowing, liquid feelings 
 Break you!!! 
 Try to mend your previous times, 
 Your dreams are longer than your time 
 Mix your blood with gold and fire 
 And fight out!!! 
 Sometimes I feel nothing can help me 
 Sometimes I need to break my routine 
 Someone told me the only solution 
 Fill up your life with... HEAVY METAL!!!!!
########### Home ###########
Wreckage, my mind 
 Insecure, all the time 
 Once loved, now paralyzed 
 I once thought, I'll never die 
 Frustrated, our simple life 
 No one listens, everyone lies 
 Who said "home is where you hide"? 
 Strong as shit and now you see 
 [Chorus:] 
 I'm home, leave it to me 
 (leave it to me now that you've seen) 
 I'm home, leave it to me 
 (leave it to me) 
 From left to right... 
 (Repeat) 
 I tried, my father said 
 I'm scared, she always said 
 They grab and pull until I tear 
 Meaning, too deep to swim 
 When's a good time for the end? 
 Who said I was your friend? 
 [Chorus:] 
 From left to right... 
 (repeat) 
 Suffocated, our simple life 
 No one listens, everyone dies 
 Never a chance, how could you see? 
 [Chorus:] 
 I'm home - leave it to me (what the fuck did you say?) 
 From left to right... 
 (repeat)
########### I Don't Give Up ###########
I'm stuck in modern life 
 Every day is on repeat 
 I'm on a highway straight to misery 
 I only wanna sleep 
 I'm just trying to forget 
 I don't even feel my favorite things 
 I can't live like that no more 
 It's time to face the truth 
 Time to die or to stand upright now 
 I can not give up right now 
 Let the shadows eat my life 
 I still need to believe 
 You are my fire (fire) fire 
 My one true desire ('sire) 'sire 
 Cause you keep me warm through the storm 
 With you I dare to be myself 
 I don't give up up up up up up up 
 I don't give up up up up up up up 
 I don't give up up up up up up up 
 I don't give up up up up up 
 Before I fade away 
 We almost realize 
 You are here cause two hearts made some love 
 And I can't let go all the people out there count on me 
 There still is love inside 
 No I (won't) won't give up 
 No I (won't) won't give up 
 On love 
 Oh it's worth all the blood 
 Every single drop 
 For love 
 You are my fire (fire) fire 
 My one true desire ('sire) 'sire 
 Cause you keep me warm through the storm 
 With you I dare to be myself 
 I don't give up up up up up up up (I don't give up) 
 I don't give up up up up up up up (I) 
 I don't give up up up up up up up (No I don't give up) 
 I don't give up up up up up up up (No I don't give up) 
 I don't give up up up up up up up (No I don't give up) 
 I don't give up up up up up up (No I don't give up)
########### One With The Land ###########
I went in circles for a long time 
 And always seemed to come back to where I started 
 I searched for places far beyond my mind 
 But found that peace of mind was buried here 
 Along this sacred land 
 From this day and forever after 
 I will carry my flag with honour and pride 
 Gliding through all the empty faces 
 Reflecting 
 -The colors I've seen 
 -The shade of who I am 
 -My pain disappears 
 When the questions had no answers 
 When all knowledge was beyond reach 
 I had a strange but present feeling 
 That I would find this place 
 -I've been here all the time without knowing 
 From this day and forever after 
 I will carry my cross with honour and pride 
 Through the years to my final journey 
 I will alaways remember this day 
 -And I hold my hands high 
 -Embraced by this moment 
 I'm one with the land I've found out who I am 
 Don't let dreams fade away 
 I follow my faith to where it leads me... 
 Dream away, I'll be keeping the light when I'm shown here again 
 Breathing again, I'll let go of the pain that I've felt to this day 
 And this strong feeling will guide me the way from drifting away again 
 I won't let it fade away
########### Silence My Voice ###########
Make my voice a crime - I will cry out louder 
 Silence my voice - I will create a new one 
 Make my signs a crime - I will hold them higher 
 Silence my voice - ten will raise to take my place 
 Silence my voice - but my words will live forever 
 Silence my voice - but my words will live forever 
 There comes a time to take back what was mine 
 When our colours're waving in the wind 
 I will never give in - we will never give in 
 We just play it out louder like many did before 
 And nothing can stop us, cause there comes many more 
 We just play it out louder like many did before 
 And nothing can stop us, cause there comes many more 
 Every day I seek ways to convince them 
 That it's still not too late to react 
 And I think to myself - what a wonderful day 
 When we'll throw them all away
########### Today The March Begins ###########
In forgotten places where the sun doesn't shine 
 I'm walking through my shadow to confront my beliefs 
 I've always tried to keep up with the truth that I know 
 So I can recognize the face I see in the mirror 
 Forever free from the lies I used to hear 
 Never again they will arise 
 We can never tell what's right or wrong 
 If we keep on pretending we're blind 
 Today the march begins we know you stand by our side 
 This night nothing can stop us and our dream 
 Rise up to be free with us and show them your light 
 Returning from dark years right in our time 
 Can we break the chains of silence? 
 Are the answers there to find? 
 Darkness hides the truth from their eyes 
 The time for our stand is now 
 Tomorrow and forever on is our time to rule 
 The victory together we will find 
 The song will once again make you remember the words 
 You'll never walk alone here from this day
########### United ###########
Can you be free from your heavy load? 
 You will find that your dreams come true 
 Can you see through the endless lies? 
 You will find that your goals are near 
 There's no time to wait for the sunlight 
 It's so easy to just fade away 
 Let your heart glow through the seasons 
 Join this journey to find better days 
 Fill the long empty days 
 Take power through strength 
 Find your own way 
 United by faith 
 United we stand 
 United we stand - forever now 
 United we stand 
 For this day, for this time 
 On through the night in the winter snow 
 In the end there's light to find 
 Struggle so hard to fulfill my quest 
 But I know that my time will come 
 I've got nothing to lose on this journey 
 Cause I started with two empty hands 
 I see light in the end of the tunnel 
 I won't let anything pass me by 
 I won't wait for the sun to reach me 
 I will make it rise by myself 
 Glory days from the past won't come back 
 We'll create a new time and make our own rules
########### Voices ###########
"Love, just don't stare" 
 He used to say to me 
 Every Sunday morning 
 The spider in the window 
 The angel in the pool 
 The old man takes the poison 
 Now the widow makes the rules 
 "So speak, I'm right here" 
 She used to say to me 
 Not a word, not a word 
 Judas on the ceiling 
 The devil in my bed 
 I guess Easter's never coming 
 So I'll just wait inside my head 
 Like a scream but sort of silent 
 Living off my nightmares 
 Voices repeating me 
 "Feeling threatened? 
 We reflect your hopes and fears" 
 Voices discussing me 
 "Others steal your thoughts 
 They're not confined 
 Within your mind" 
 Thought disorder 
 Dream control 
 Now they read my mind on the radio 
 But where was the garden of Eden? 
 I feel elated 
 I feel depressed 
 Sex is death, death is sex 
 Says it right here on my crucifix 
 Like a scream but sort of silent 
 Living off my nightmares 
 Voices protecting me 
 "Good behavior 
 Brings the savior 
 To his knees" 
 Voices rejecting me 
 "Others steal your thoughts 
 They're not confined 
 To your own mind" 
 "I don't wanna be here, 'cause of my 
 Suffering, 'cause of my illness. 
 Only love is worth having, only 
 Love is what matters, loving every 
 People on equal terms." 
 "You've got to know who you're 
 Dealin' with, because, like a stranger, 
 A-heh, just might come in through 
 Here with a gun... and then, what 
 Would you do? (Heh.)" 
 "Everything is immaterial..." 
 "'n' you know that reality is immaterial." 
 "This is not reality..." 
 I'm kneeling on the floor 
 Staring at the wall 
 Like the spider in the window 
 I wish that I could speak 
 Is there fantasy in refuge? 
 God in politicians? 
 Should I turn on my religion? 
 These demons in my head tell me to 
 I'm lying here in bed 
 Swear my skin is inside out 
 Just another Sunday morning 
 Seen my diary on the newsstand 
 Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand 
 It's a shame no one is praying 
 'cause these voices in my head 
 Keep saying... 
 "Love, just don't stare." 
 "Reveal the Word when you're supposed to." 
 Withdrawn and introverted 
 Infectiously perverted 
 "Being laughed at and confused 
 Keeps us pleasantly amused 
 Enough to stay." 
 Maybe I'm just Cassandra fleeting 
 Twentieth century Icon bleeding 
 Willing to risk salvation 
 To escape from isolation 
 I'm witness to redemption 
 Heard you speak but never listened 
 Can you rid me of my secrets? 
 Deliver us from darkness? 
 Voices repeating me 
 "Feeling threatened? 
 We reflect your hopes and fears." 
 Voices discussing me 
 "on't expect your own Messiah 
 This neverworld which you desire 
 Is only in your mind."

########### Winter Scenes ###########
Far away in fields of dreams 
 I held you near 
 Our love was clear 
 And whispers were heard 
 Long ago in cold land towns 
 I felt your light 
 Shades of the night 
 Played Mellotron songs 
 There in the night 
 She slips into my sleeping 
 It seems to have the feelings 
 From afar, all its own 
 If in snowy fields at night 
 I held you near 
 Our lips would seal 
 A fantasy so rare 
 Then at once again I knew 
 That our bodies touched 
 I felt the rush 
 Was always there 
 There in the night 
 She slips into my sleeping 
 It seems to have the feeling 
 From afar, all its own 
 Long were the nights in winter dreams 
 Colder than the ice that night 
 Lone were the winds 
 And high their sting 
 Telling me to break my vow 
 Long were the games in winter scenes 
 Villages soft and white and clean 
 Brown are the wings that flown here 
 Long ago in cold land towns 
 I held you near 
 Our love was clear 
 And whispering was heard 
 Far away in fields of dreams 
 I felt your light 
 Shades of the night 
 Played Mellotron songs 
 There in the night 
 She slips into my sleeping 
 It seems to have the feelings 
 From a far distant star
########### Step Back ###########
Darling something's happened 
 You're not the same 
 I feel it every time you look my way 
 Maybe I should not say this 
 But it's so true 
 You're slowly fading from my view 
 Step back to the right side 
 Move in from the outside 
 Step back to the right side of your, heart 
 Do you still remember those days in spring 
 You trusted me in every way 
 You know I really loved you 
 Right from the start 
 You took me for a ride it's true 
 Step back to the right side 
 Move in from the outside 
 Step back to the right side of your, heart 
 They say every mornin' has it's glory 
 I see the light come shinin' through, 
 But you know there's much more to my story 
 But darlin' 
 Oh, I'm lost without you 
 Step back to the right side 
 Move in from the outside 
 Step back to the right side of your, heart 
 Darling something's happened 
 You're not the same 
 I need you much too much today 
 You know I really loved you 
 Right from the start 
 I've got to find a brand new heart 
 Step back to the right side 
 Move in from the outside 
 Step back to the right side of your, heart 
 Yeah 
 Step back to the right side 
 Move in from the outside 
 Step back to the right side of your, heart
########### You Told Me ###########
You told me I would not have to cry 
 But why then are there tears in my eyes 
 I'd like to pretend that it's all right 
 But you think I'm acting out a lie 
 Where in the world do you think you're going 
 Who in the world do you hope to meet 
 Wouldn't it be nice just to sit back 
 Softly talking spending time with me 
 We're playing, playing with our lives 
 You don't seem, seem to realize 
 You taught me that you could make me laugh 
 You owe me, you owe me more than that 
 Picture yourself without a conscience 
 Project a thought you'd like to see 
 Let yourself melt into the darkness 
 Bring yourself down 
 Come away with me 
 There is a place where two can't be 
 One shady leg for two maybe 
 You 
 You told me you told me not to cry 
 But why then are there tears in my eye 
 Now you think I'm living out a lie 
 Where in the world do you think you're going 
 Who in the world do you hope to meet 
 Wouldn't it be nice just to sit back 
 Softly talking spending time with me 
 Whoo

########### Kathleen ###########
Kathleen where you think your going now 
 My images are turning round, 
 When you, left you said that you'd return 
 It's been so long 
 I should have learned 
 You won't be here again 
 There is nothing left to send 
 Ooh just how much more 
 Can I stand 
 Yes I need your hand 
 I can't go on 
 Darling when you walked into the sun 
 I knew that you would have your fun 
 With me or without 
 I said you'd live 
 A better life if you could give 
 Down beneath the waves of love 
 While looking for you 
 Can these melodies applaud 
 The feelings for you that...I....hold 
 You won't be here again 
 There is nothing left to send to me 
 Just how much more 
 Can I stand 
 Yes I need your hands 
 I can't go on 
 Kathleen where you think your going now 
 My images are turning round 
 Mysteries abound in happiness 
 Our time is growing less and less 
 Down beneath the waves of love 
 While looking for you 
 Can these melodies applaud 
 The feelings for you that...I....hold
########### Take Cover ###########
People, shape reality 
 They don't know that 
 Nothing left for them to see 
 Hear them calling, ooh 
 Angels fly at dawn 
 See them falling 
 Nothing left to carry on 
 But I, know that, 
 Life's too short 
 Take cover my love my love 
 There's nothing left to hide 
 Take cover my love my love 
 If you want to to survive 
 You know, oh yeah 
 You know that it's true 
 There's too much to 
 Much too much for them to do 
 But I, know that, 
 Once again 
 Take cover my love my love 
 There's nothing left to hide 
 Take cover my love my love 
 C'mon woman here inside 
 Once again I stand here 
 Waiting for the show to start 
 Don't you know my times too short 
 Take cover my love my love 
 There's nothing left to hide 
 Take cover my love my love 
 C'mon woman now there inside 
 Take cover my love my love
########### Nice To Have You Here ###########
Sitting alone waiting for 
 You to come home 
 It's just so nice to have you here 
 Where you belong 
 If I could say what of here 
 In my head 
 I would give only all the love 
 I have to share 
 Another sleepless day 
 Try to run away 
 I've got this feeling 
 Here inside, 
 Take a trip through space 
 Find you come to rest 
 All of the moments beautiful 
 Watching the rain throwing 
 Pennies away 
 Yes I can feel your hand in mine 
 Naked today 
 Ah ah ah ah 
 Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 
 If I could say what of here 
 In my head 
 I would give only all the love 
 I have to share 
 Better days ahead 
 Rest within my bed 
 You know that children need their rest 
 Stand within the light 
 Don't you feel the night 
 What we seek only 
 Comes but once 
 Sitting alone waiting for 
 You to come home 
 It's just so nice to have you here 
 Where you belong 
 It's just so nice to have you here 
 Making me strong
########### High And Low ###########
You don't seem the same way now 
 Like you did before 
 And you don't smile the same way now 
 Someone locked the door 
 But high and low 
 High and low 
 I'm tryin' to get through to you 
 The other side has such a lovely view 
 You know that I have nothing to show you 
 Thoughts you buried long ago 
 It's hard to say them now 
 You dug your grave so deep and cold 
 You've got to lie alone 
 But high and low 
 High and low 
 I'm tryin' to get through to you 
 The other side has such a lovely view 
 You know that I have nothing to show you 
 There's a reason you let me hear the storm 
 There's a reason you left me here 
 You left me here alone 
 Oh god no 
 But high and low 
 High and low 
 I'm tryin' to get through to you 
 The other side has such a lovely view 
 You know that I have nothing to show you 
 You don't seem the same way now 
 Like you did before 
 And you don't smile the same way now 
 Someone locked the door 
 But high and low 
 Oh high and low 
 I'm tryin' to get through to you 
 The other side has such a lovely view 
 You know that I have nothing to show you
########### Darling ###########
Darling, can you see it something inside 
 Can't be denied it's the way that you feel it 
 If you want it, you gotta try 
 Taking the best of the lesson 
 You know when the night has turned to dawn I will be gone 
 Where's the reason and the strength to carry on 
 Come back, I can see you far behind 
 Taking a chance and forgetting the reason 
 That I need you on my mind 
 Making the best of the season 
 For now is there nothing in the world that takes in sound 
 For the more we can conceive the more we found 
 Darling can you feel it? I need your love 
 I need the way that you make me feel 
 Darling if you want it, you can be sure 
 Taking the best of the lesson 
 You know there's so many in the stars watching the sky 
 And you know that somehow most of them will cry

########### Changes Have Begun ###########
I didn't know 
 But now I can see 
 That the darkness doesn't have to be 
 Things they can change 
 The circles been round 
 And there's nothing that can hold us down 
 There's just one more thing I need 
 To end this misery and pain 
 That's to hear you feel the same, as I do 
 And we'll be gettin' through 
 All that was left 
 And all that was cold 
 Is now slowly turning into gold 
 All that we give 
 And all that we feel 
 Are the vistas yet to be revealed 
 Yes the colors can be vivid 
 In the ever falling rain 
 In the shadows to remain 
 Evermore, what we were living for 
 We had to live a world filled with uncertainty, 
 I shudder to think how our every move stood child 
 Now is the time to demand more than just your courtesy, 
 And by standing up strong and by coming along 
 Make those times worthwhile 
 All that was left 
 And all that was cold 
 Is now slowly turning into gold 
 All that we give 
 And all that we feel 
 Are the vistas yet to be revealed 
 As we turn to find we've left behind 
 What once could make us stay 
 As we make our getaway 
 To the sun 
 The changes have begun 
 We had to live a world with uncertainty,

########### Words ###########
On a ride into a valley 
 Hidden by the city lights 
 Saw a man 
 And asked him if he knew a place 
 To spend the night 
 As he turned he whispered words 
 That I knew I'd heard before, 
 Something strange about the way 
 That he spoke which told me more 
 Now come and we'll go moving slow 
 Keep time with the music 
 All the worlds are coming out to us this night 
 Don't be long soon will be gone 
 No more to this daydream 
 I can still remember the light in his eyes 
 Don't be long, the snow is falling harder on 
 The fields tonight 
 In it's light the moon will help to make our transformation right 
 Softer then I heard a call from the village far below, 
 Words with song that hypnotized me and I just had to go 
 So hurry along 
 Sing a song 
 Keep time with the music 
 From the past I can call images to mind 
 Highway signs I couldn't find, could I be mistaking 
 What I once thought could have been stars in his eyes 
 Hurry along 
 Sing a song 
 Keep time with the music 
 Sing the words 
 I'm wanting to keep by my side 
 Don't be long soon you'll be gone 
 No more to this daydream 
 When you wake you'll find your back on city time 
 Woah
########### Top Of The City ###########
Nothing is sacred 
 Nothing at all 
 Nothings been written 
 Not meant to fall 
 Top of the city 
 Bringing me down 
 It's such a pity 
 Keeping around 
 Yes I see through 
 Your ivory tower 
 Yes I'm passing through the hourglass 
 I'm nowhere gotten nowhere 
 I can't believe it 
 Stars shining through 
 Heaven thought pity 
 Beautiful you 
 Top of the city 
 Bringing me down 
 Lost on the highway 
 Got to be bound 
 I can feel that, heaven sent light on me 
 I've got to find direction 
 Can't take none on protection 
 Ooh yeah, 
 Yes I see through 
 Your ivory tower child, 
 Yes I'm passing through the hourglass 
 I'm nowhere gotten nowhere
########### What Comes After ###########
What comes after 
 The laughter 
 I open my eyes 
 Great disaster came after 
 I started to cry 
 I lie I try to pray 
 What comes after 
 What matters 
 Has gone far away 
 Peace comes after 
 Disaster 
 We all fade away 
 I lie I try to pray 
 What comes after 
 And after 
 I open my eyes 
 Strange disaster 
 Came laster 
 I started to cry 
 And now I find I'm blind
########### Brother Louie ###########
She was black as the night 
 Louie was whiter than white 
 Danger, danger when you taste brown sugar 
 Louie fell in love overnight 
 Nothing bad, it was good 
 Louie had the best girl he could 
 When he took her home to meet his mama and papa 
 Louie knew just where he stood 
 Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie 
 Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-I 
 Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie 
 Louie, Louie you're gonna cry 
 There he stood in the night 
 Knowing what's wrong from what's right 
 He took her home to meet his mama and papa 
 Man, he had a terrible fight 
 Louie nearly caused a scene 
 Wishin' it was a dream 
 Ain't no difference if you're black or white 
 Brothers you know what I mean 
 Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie 
 Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-I-I 
 Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie 
 Louie, Louie you're gonna cry

 Is all it takes to ease the pain
########### Hard When You're So Far Away ###########
Darlin' did I tell you 
 That I thought of you today 
 Lost in thought I turned to speak 
 As if you'd hear what I'd say 
 Hours, days I while a way 
 In the remembrance 
 Of our child ways 
 Even so it hurts to know 
 You can't be with, 
 Me now 
 And it's hard 
 With you so faraway 
 And it's hard 
 When you're not here 
 Darlin' did I mention 
 That I dreamed of you last night 
 Words we spoke 
 Renewed the promise 
 Spirits shining bright 
 I awoke and smiled I hope 
 Of our reunion, our reunion 
 Desperate dreams 
 And half-baked schemes 
 Bring out this stew of confusion 
 And it's hard 
 When, you're so faraway 
 And it's hard 
 When you're not here 
 Darlin' did I tell you 
 That I thought of you today

Magic mystic, in the forest 
 With the lady by your side 
 On a white horse 
 She said she'd guide me 
 Out of rivers wide

 Simple vision in the darkness 
 Of the future pictures unfold 
 Prince and princess 
 In their courtyard 
 All share some love

I got the shakes 
 But it's always colder in the morning 
 What a mistake 
 I thought we'd both be better off alone, 
 I tried to be protective and, live an exile 
 But I thought I'd be with her in a while 
 I can't understand It 
 When I think of everything that we've done, 
 She told me it's over 
 Just before I'd even knew it begun 
 Back in L.A. she so sassy nasty as she has to be, 
 I couldn't stay 
 But there's no way I could make it back at home 
 Too many times I've felt by the 
 Look in her eyes 
 Too many times then I've realized 
 I can't understand It 
 When I think of everything that we've done, 
 She told me it's over 
 Just before, I ever knew, that we'd begun 
 I can't understand It 
 When I think of everything that we've done 
 She told me it's over 
 Just before I ever knew it begun 
 Looking at me 
 Like she's got a finger on my trigger, 
 Trying to be 
 Like a queen and patient waiting for her throne 
 God how she gets despondent and 
 Moodies about 
 Those are the times when we have it out 
 I don't want to worry 
 But I'm living in perpetual doubt 
 So hard to be with her 
 But it's so much harder to live without 
 I can't understand It 
 When I think of everything that we've done 
 She told me it's over 
 Just before, I ever knew, that we'd begun

########### Cash Her In ###########
By now I can hear the sirens. They're getting close now. Just hold one more minute. Time is against us now. Someone call for help. Save her she's going to die. Turning. Replaying it all in my head. Walk onto death and let the stars be your compass. Pray for stars. Don't close your eyes just yet. Faster now. We're picking up speed. We're set to crash. You're dragging your feet again. So walk onto death. With words unspoken I've given up. I've given up on you. By now I can hear the sirens. They're getting close now. Just hold one more minute. Time is against us now. Someone call for help. Save her she's going to die. Turning. Replaying it all in my head. Walk onto death and let the stars be your compass. Brace your fall
########### Floodgates ###########
Tonight early dusk will bring you fear that I'll be gone. Like a shadow with the dark. Fleeting like the northern winds. Catch me as I pass you by. Will you follow me as the wind blows through the open window and crosses your face will a cool breeze. I'm all around you. I am everywhere. How does it feel to have the tables turned. What compels you. Is it courage or fear that drives you. I hope you're finally happy that I've gone away. We'll be swept away. When I open the floodgates. We will be swept away. Open the window and let in the night air. Release me. Into a world not so cold. Not so cold. Do you know what it's like to breath through someone else's lungs. Follow the trade winds. But they won't bring you sleep. To find the place where I lay my head. The prevailing winds will bring us down
########### Holy Mess ###########
We're going down. Into churning waters and we will plunge. Through the great divide and we will be buried in the water. We will be buried in the water. Buried in the water. Swallowed by the mouth of God. Caught in this single form. I will take your fury. She got the taste of blood in her mouth. So feed her to the sharks. The water is building up. The water is building in her lungs. Drown. The water is rising. The water is building up. The water is rising. So hold your breath and drown. Just let me go. Because you'd give up everything for nothing. You'd give up everything for nothing. You'd give up everything. Pushing my head underwater. Could you imagine. Pushing my head underwater. We're going down. Into churning waters and we will plunge. Through the great divide and we will be buried in the water. We will be buried in the water. Death tides. Carry the bodies ashore. As I walk closer to the end. Is this the only thing we have. To try and stay above. The churning water. Is this the only thing we have. To try and keep from drowning. I'll count the bodies you have left behind. I'll count the bodies that you have left behind. Walk onto death. Hold your breath and drown. She got the taste of blood in her mouth. Blood
########### Tractor Pull ###########
Not for nothing, but you'd give it all. My heart is blackened with your lies. Bury me in an unmarked grave. You have destroyed everything. Living in the past is now. Some things will never change. You wore out your welcome. You've overstayed your time. So get yourself together. Some things will never change. So let's destroy. Fucking destroy. Your fucking life. No one wants to see the fucking truth. I didn't take part in the demise of thousands. I promise you'll get yours. Sooner of later. I promise. Sooner or later. Judgment will be paid. The price will be paid. Our hearts could never weather the storm. Who were we kidding. How long can I go before I take myself out. How long can I go. Living in the past is now. Some things will never change. You wore out your welcome. You've overstayed your time. Get yourself together. Throw me in an unmarked grave
########### Tug Of War ###########
Captivate. You're captivating at best. You're pulling at my neck. My neck. Lead astray. Taking me by the hand. Show me the way. I tried so hard to leave. I tried so fucking hard to go. The memories lost and the promises broken. Broken by your actions. What were you thinking. I thought I knew you better. Lost in translation. The words that hang from your lips. Carry me. Did you think I wouldn't see right through you. The memories lost and promises broken. It's not too late to look back. The memories of me and you are all that I have to look for. It's not too late to look back. It's not too late to look back now. It's not too late. I regret. I regret all of my words. I'll take it all back. Love is nothing. Tragedy. Tragedy will only bring us down. You're always coming out on top. You're always coming out on top when you should be six feet under. Fuck the memories. Where lip-locked lovers die. Burn the pictures of our past. I had to see it die. Incisions have reached their point. Erase the loaded past. Burn the pictures of our past. I had to see it die.

########### Dig A Ditch ###########
I tried to make this easy. I'm feeling pretty crazy. I'm just trying to figure it out. I can't keep pretending. I'm feeling something different. Separate the day from the night. We could be the ones to start the fight so give up and give in. I still cannot believe what you did to get away. I still cannot believe your choice. I still cannot believe what you did to get away from me, what you did to get away. She took her last bow and opened to the light. She pulled the knife out of her back. She pulled the knife from her back. We've been breathing down your neck the whole time. You've been waiting for the duel of the fates. Catch your breath. Try and catch your breath. We've been breathing down your neck. One shot to the neck. Try and catch your breath. Straight shot to the neck. Try and catch your breath. Breathe. I tried to make this easy. I'm feeling pretty crazy. I'm just trying to figure it out. I'm feeling something different. You're pushing the envelope again. She pulled the knife out of her back. She pulled the knife from her back.
########### Call Of The Wedding ###########
Our love dies tonight. Come on and take your best shot. You've already hit me with your worst. My heart is broken. My mind is weak. Come on and kick me while I'm down. We will both collide. Bid your farewell. I've been through your hell. I've come this far. Take your best shot. Their eyes were watching God and he was watching back. Read my lips bitch. I shared my world. Now drag me through your hell. I showed you all I had. Now drag me through your hell. Feed the pigs. I told you she's a knockout. Shackled by the sound of your voice, but it's the one thing that's keeping me alive. Call off the wedding and cancel the band. Tell the caterers to feed the pigs. Your words sting like bullets going through me. If only they loaded this gun. I told you she's a knockout. You've buried yourself in lies. You've buried yourself now. Destroy the bonds that you have tied. Destroy the paths that you have cleared. Burn the bridges that you have built. Burn this city.
########### Extinguish Them ###########
Silence. Falls upon the room he condemns. All eyes ahead. Now that I have got your attention. All eyes to the front of the room. Listen closely. Now that I have got your attention. Listen closely. I won't repeat myself. Read these words. I speak these truths. Watch them bring us down. I speak the truth. You will be know for nothing. You will be left for dead. You will be know for nothing. You will be left for dead. Devour the sick and spit out the weak. Sell the poor to the slaves. Devour the sick and spit out the weak. Sell the poor to the slaves and extinguish them. Chapels burn and rooftops crash. Chapels burn. Rooftops crash. I hate the world. I hate the world so let it hate me back. Now that I have your attention. Believe what you want. You're just better off living in the darkness. Believe what you want. Is this what you want. We believe in what we want. We don't believe in any of your shit. No. We believe in what we want. We don't believe in any of your shit. Why. Why am I the one who suffers from your choices. You decided my fate. Living amongst the men that have perished. Let the whole thing burn. We built this land on glory. Save me from the end.
########### Creature ###########
I've seen how it goes. You've played this card before. I've already seen your hand. You deserve the hand you've been dealt. I'll be laughing all the way to the bank. You deserve the hand you've been dealt. We'll see who comes out on top in the end. All eyes on the sky. You better sleep with one eye open. It creeps in, in the night. Wake up. Wake up the plagues it's coming tonight. Hurry to the door. Shut the windows. Don't say a word. This could be our last night. It creeps in the night. Have the tellers call the cops. There's a whore on the run. She's headed your way. Wait for it. I know you're dying to hear my side of the story we seem to tangle ourselves in. I'll try to clear my lungs. I'll be resuscitated. I've struggled against the tide. Try to sink this ship. Is that all you've got? Now believe my story. Sucked to the depths. I lost my crew. I lost it all.
########### Versus ###########
If God is real, 
 then he's an evil motherfucker. 
 He's watching his greatest creation die. 
 Before his eyes. 
 Dead before his eyes. 
 Oh. 
 There is a war outside, so, wake, up. 
 If God, is real, 
 he's probably kicking back. 
 Enjoying the show. 
 As, his greatest creation, 
 Cries before his eyes. 
 Cries because he lies. 
 Here i am 
 With arms wide open 
 I'm calling you out 
 Show yourself 
 I'm calling you out 
 show yourself 
 I'm calling, I'm calling you out 
 If God is real, 
 then he's an evil motherfucker. 
 He's watching his greatest creation die. 
 Before his eyes. 
 Dead before his eyes. 
 Fuck your mysterious ways 
 Fuck your gift of free will 
 This is me versus you 
 This is me in my finest hour 
 I'm calling you out 
 This is me versus you 
 This is me in my finest hour 
 I'm fucking calling you out 
 Without him you are godless 
 With him you are fucking hopeless 
 Fucking hopeless 
 This is me versus you 
 This is me in my finest hour 
 This is me calling you out 
 Calling you 
 Calling you
########### Behold The Harlot ###########
I see the river of lies you hide under that stone cold surface proudly, shrouding yourself 
 Your malicious intent was masked with a pleasant smile, vicious beauty and an aura to match 
 The perfect recipe for any fools demise, demise, any fools demise 
 Yes I miss the caress of her tender skin and demon eyes 
 I breathe no more 
 Yes I miss the caress of her tender skin and demon eyes 
 I need no more like a virus with no agenda, an addiction with no reprisal 
 What a tangled web you weave 
 Give as much as you take, but the taking has just begun 
 Knowing this all good and well I cant stay away cause I can still smell you on my fingers 
 I still see your face when I close my eyes 
 Your face 
 Lust has turned into obsession and I want out
########### Red Flagged ###########
War screamed from your mouth 
 as we sat and watched patiently 
 while madness began taking over. 
 This was a red flag screaming 
 we were cast out and ignored, 
 and then the bullets began streaming. 
 I can lift my hand and make it all new again. 
 I can speak one word and you will never hear again. 
 I send plagues of weapons to eliminate your kind. 
 But we never asked, we never asked for this. 
 We do not fear what you have done, 
 we fear what you have become. 
 Try to save yourselves. 
 When it rains, it will pour 
 dissolve all, all of our reckoning. 
 A spark of deviance 
 will shatter any glimmer of hope 
 and all will become submissive. 
 This is what we feared, 
 I'll be your architect of doom.
########### Invade ###########
Digging through trenches still 
 but our work is not done yet. 
 Forcing ourselves 
 through all who oppose. 
 We are not afraid to get our hands dirty, 
 not afraid because we were always filthy. 
 Knee deep in what we love, 
 but our work is not done yet. 
 We've got a job to do. 
 Never turn your back on us 
 We stand tall, we stand firm 
 Now it's time to hit them where it hurts. 
 Walk towards us 
 and stand in our shadow. 
 Walk towards us 
 and be the ones that follow. 
 We've gotten our hands dirty 
 and we wont stop now. 
 To think that we would stop 
 you must have lost 
 your fucking mind. 
 We are continuous, 
 We are never ending. 
 We'll give you something to believe in 
 let us be your breath of fresh air. 
 Now breathe us in. 
 We are bringing life into something stagnant. 
 You lost your fucking mind. 
 We will stand aside, 
 one by one 
 watch you die.
########### Crossbuster ###########
I'm getting something off my chest, see I never liked your religion organized 
 Ive learned to keep my mouth shut, Ive learned to hold my tongue, but this has gone way too far 
 How can you preach unity while practicing segregation? 
 Hes never coming, no ressurections 
 Hes never coming because he did not exist 
 I believe what I believe so dont force your faith on me 
 Were in this world together, saints or sinners, it makes no difference 
 Im free to speak my mind because nothing is sacred 
 You add to our decline while holding the hand of God 
 You add to our decline while holding the hand of God 
 Faith is just a crutch to lean on so fear what you dont know 
 Youre just blinding yourself with false security 
 Living a life of lies, I hope you take offense to this 
 You have passed judgment on me, now Im judging you
########### Feast Or Famine ###########
In a dying world its feast or famine, breathe deep and take your pick 
 Dont act like theres an option, youll be the one who fades quick 
 Watch the sky swallow the sun one more time and take in the nights empty serenity 
 No plan of action, no grand schemes 
 No sanctuary, no hope for change 
 Having tasted a better life puts me... 
 At the bottom for so long, gazing at the opening above me 
 I see a hope for change, I see a hope for more 
 Just sacrifice for survival 
 Life is what you make it 
 What you make it 
 No holding back 
 Today I feast on this spoiled world as the rest famine 
 As the rest famine below me, as the rest famine
########### Oath ###########
A wise man once told me I reminded him of himself when he was young 
 He saw the respect in my eyes and said "Stop at nothing and I will see you again one day" 
 I have stood where you are standing 
 I have thought what you are thinking 
 Now I stand before you sharing my story 
 There is nothing wrong with chasing a dream 
 There is nothing wrong with chasing your dream 
 These words might be simple but they will change your life 
 You will gain everything and regret nothing 
 Regret nothing 
 Remember how you get here, something no one can take from you 
 Experiences to last a lifetime, and no one can take them from you 
 Take them from you 
 Just live and don’t look back, if it seems that you have failed 
 Dust yourself off and wipe the sweat from your head 
 Set the stage 
 Scrape my bones from the pavement 
 Light the fuse and run 
 Were all in danger 
 The clock is ticking and our time will soon expire 
 This road can kill you but its worth every mile 
 Im never leaving here 
 Im never coming home
########### The Carousser ###########
Woke up this morning and decided today wasn’t good enough 
 So tonight Im drinking for all the wrong reasons, destruction at its best 
 As I point the bottle to the sky, I find what Ive been looking for this whole time 
 As I point the bottle to the sky, I find what Ive been looking for this whole time 
 Ive really brought the best out in me, or so I thought… 
 As I remember why today wasn’t good enough 
 Good enough 
 As I point the bottle to the sky, I find what Ive been looking for my whole life 
 All went black in an instant, the sun poured down on me 
 And all I could repeat, through my throbbing mind 
 All I could repeat through my throbbing mind (was) my eyes have seen better days
########### Controller ###########
Fear is the mind controller. 
 Fear is the mind destroyer. 
 Instill fear into the mind of the weak, 
 And obtain the power that you seek. 
 A method used since the dawn of time, 
 Bet your ass will fall in line 
 Pain was granted to those who tried to stray from order. 
 Trust is a flaw in every man's design, 
 And you are not worthy of mine. 
 This is not the life i had in mind. 
 This will not be the way i carry on. 
 This is not the life i had in mind. 
 I will not life under this veil. 
 Over all that is spread before out me, 
 I exist, above dismay, over fear. 
 Over all that is exposed before me. 
 I exist. 
 I exist. 
 Fear in nothing, no man, no god. 
 Fear in nothing, no words, no creed. 
 Over all that is spread out before me, 
 I exist, above dismay, above fear. 
 Above dismay, above fear, above all. 
 Over all that is exposed before me. 
 I exist. 
 It's time to separate yourself from the grip of this oppression.
########### Infamy ###########
I disgust the people that make this planet so ugly. 
 I despise the people who make us, make us so weary. 
 To the liars, cheaters, and fakes. 
 The ones draining any sense of dignity; 
 Go ahead and tell me I'm wrong. 
 The greedy, the corrupt and religious rite. 
 Just three more examples of who I spite. 
 Anyone of them would see you die, 
 All you have to do is name a price. 
 So name your price. 
 Anyone of them would see you die, 
 All you have to do is name a price. 
 So name your price. 
 People dying to survive right outside your door. 
 It's not you, so fuck it right? 
 My hatred will outpour. 
 I scream so you can hear me. 
 Can you fucking here me? 
 Greed has poisoned the soul of man, 
 Barricading the world with hate. 
 Humanity is misery. 
 Underneath your prophecy. 
 You will see the savagery. 
 You will follow me. 
 Irresolute reality. 
 Shrouded in hypocrisy. 
 Blinded by disparity, my misanthropy. 
 The bad outweigh the good. 
 The corrupt dominate the pure. 
 This is the world in which we live; 
 This is my justified misanthropy. 
 And so it goes.
########### Carry On Wayward Son ###########
Carry on my wayward son 
 There'll be peace when you are done 
 Lay your weary head to rest 
 Don't you cry no more 
 Once I rose above the noise and confusion 
 Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion 
 I was soaring ever higher 
 But I flew too high 
 Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man 
 Though my mind could think I still was a mad man 
 I hear the voices when I'm dreaming 
 I can hear them say 
 Masquerading as a man with a reason 
 My charade is the event of the season 
 And if I claim to be a wise man, well 
 It surely means that I don't know 
 On a stormy sea of moving emotion 
 Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean 
 I set a course for winds of fortune 
 But I hear the voices say 
 No! 
 Carry on, you will always remember 
 Carry on, nothing equals the splendor 
 The center lights around your vanity 
 But surely heaven waits for you 
 Carry on my wayward son 
 There'll be peace when you are done 
 Lay your weary head to rest 
 Don't you cry (don't you cry no more)
########### Fight Fire With Fire ###########
Do unto others as they've done to you 
 But what the hell is this world coming to? 
 Blow the universe into nothingness 
 Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest 
 Fight fire with fire 
 Ending is near 
 Fight fire with fire 
 Bursting with fear 
 We all shall die 
 Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast 
 Armageddon is here, like said in the past 
 Fight fire with fire 
 Ending is near 
 Fight fire with fire 
 Bursting with fear 
 Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death 
 The gods are laughing, so take your last breath 
 Fight fire with fire 
 Ending is near 
 Fight fire with fire 
 Bursting with fear 
 Fight fire with fire x8 
 Fight!

########### Solice ###########
The luster is now gone 
 I know where I belong 
 A vagabond by nature 
 A life only I can endure 
 I find solace, I find peace 
 I find peace in the unforeseen 
 And now my satisfaction is achieved 
 Welcome filth, accept uncertainty 
 Comfort in knowing, I am not alone 
 Passion is shared, hardships endured 
 Learn from this, and fucking grow 
 Grow 
 Live, eat, breathe, bleed 
 Striving to reach the peak 
 Sweat, grind, break, bleed 
 Satisfaction achieved 
 I find solace, I find peace 
 I find peace in the unforeseen 
 And now my satisfaction is achieved 
 This is a statement 
 To always try 
 This is a statement 
 To never die 
 Now I boldly say 
 I can never die! 
 Live, eat, breathe, bleed 
 Striving to reach the peak 
 Sweat, grind, break, bleed 
 Satisfaction achieved 
 Fuck the impending 
 The condescending 
 This is what I live by 
 A testament to always try 
 Defy, defy, defy, defy 
 I can never die! 
 Never die! 
 Always strive! 
 Never deny! 
 I was built to survive!
########### Feeding Frenzy ###########
You're eating yourself alive 
 Alive and you don't even see it 
 Accept the signs you can take it or leave it 
 What ever happened to integrity? 
 What ever happened to sincerity? 
 A feeding frenzy, a monstrosity 
 Leeching on to a host and never letting go 
 You're bleeding it dry draining it of any growth 
 Once a leech now turned into a ghost 
 This feeding frenzy has left you all alone 
 So now it's time to let go! 
 So now it's time to let go! 
 So now it's time to let go! 
 The only thing a fool knows 
 The only thing that is visible 
 Is what has been put on the pedestal 
 The only thing a fool knows 
 Leeching on to a host and never letting go 
 You're bleeding it dry draining it of any growth 
 Once a leech now turned into a ghost 
 This feeding frenzy has left you all alone 
 Their sights are set 
 And now they feed 
 Their senses are numb 
 But still they feed 
 Forgive them for they don't know what they do 
 This is all they know 
 Their senses are numb 
 And still, and still they feed 
 And still they feed 
 They're eating themselves alive 
 So now it's time to let go! 
 It's time to let go! 
 It's time to let go! 
 It's time to let 
 Go!
########### New Holy War ###########
We are wretched beings born into sin 
 The only moments of purity begin 
 Seconds away from the womb 
 Wretched beings brainwashed from birth 
 Not ever given a chance to splurge 
 Not fortunate enough to think free 
 We are our own worst enemy 
 Knowledge can be used as a key 
 Knowledge can be used as a weapon 
 Faith can lead you to find your peace 
 Faith can lead you to the deceased 
 Man gave man reasons to die 
 Man created reasons to fight 
 Man created the man in the sky 
 Man created the question why 
 We will end our world 
 And milk it for all it's worth 
 We are our worst enemy 
 Your book of revelations will come true 
 It will be nothing of what you once knew 
 Of what you once knew 
 Your fellow man will turn on you 
 Say goodbye to the world you once knew 
 Now prepare for the New Holy War 
 Weaponize and keep your god in mind 
 As you prepare to slay your fellow man 
 It is all glorified in his name 
 This is disorder, this is true horror 
 This is a mass genocide 
 A race to heavens gates with no promises of getting inside 
 Weaponize keep your god in mind 
 It all will end with this
########### The Charm ###########
Tonight's the night, and he's ready for a thrill 
 He's got a plan in place, and he's dressed to kill 
 Tonights the night, and he's dressed to impress 
 She never knew what she had coming 
 He seemed so charming, so promising 
 Any fool could see his intent 
 How could she be so blind? 
 How could she be so blind? 
 Now she wakes alone and confused 
 Now she wakes up alone and confused 
 He walks away, his mission's been fulfilled 
 He changed her life, in the blink of an eye 
 Now the predator, has become the prey 
 I'm hunting scum, that's all there is to say 
 I can't wait for his throat to fill my hands 
 I will squeeze and ignore all demands 
 Vengeance is what fills my eyes 
 I follow his every step, close behind 
 The chance to be alone is finally here 
 Can't turn back now, my motives are clear 
 Tonight's the night, and I'm ready for a thrill 
 I've got a plan in place, now I'm dressed to kill 
 Tonight's the night, and he's dressed to impress 
 Without, without a shred of innocence 
 Strap him down 
 This night of torture begins, now 
 He awakens and begins to struggle 
 Sees my face and begins to buckle 
 This is violence 
 This is revenge 
 This is violence and revenge (this is violence) 
 This is violence and revenge (this is revenge) 
 This is violence and revenge (this is violence) 
 This is violence and revenge 
 This is revenge

 Tear out the pain that you've consumed 
 Trust in me as I stare into you

 Because I have been there too 
 Because I have been there too 
 Provoke what makes you torn 
 Now flip that switch and transform

 Shed your mortal shell 
 Let those inner demons free 
 Close those eyes and dig deep 
 Clench your fists

 What makes your skin crawl 
 Channel these feelings and erupt

########### I, Blashpheme ###########
It seems I'm the anti-Christ 
 It seems I'm the devil's child 
 One look and it's clear to see 
 This is a mockery 
 I was sent to poison your minds 
 Denounce your faith and exploit the lies 
 Just take one look and it's clear to see 
 The only one laughing is me 
 (I've followed in those foot steps 
 I've strayed from that broken path) 
 You are my never-healing sore 
 A cancer I can't seem to shake 
 Seething, breathing, swarming, transforming 
 Seething, breathing, swarming, transforming 
 I'm merely here to speak no lies 
 Shed some light and open some eyes 
 Not all of us are born with an open mind 
 And some are bred into unfair lives 
 You are my never-healing sore 
 A cancer, that I can't seem to shake 
 You are my never-healing sore 
 A cancer, that I can't seem to shake 
 It seems everyone is out to criticize 
 All your judging will lead to your demise 
 I'll never be the one to watch my words 
 I will never be silenced 
 I live to get a rise out of you all 
 This is a mockery 
 You're wasting your time 
 Focusing your hate on me 
 I'm just a man 
 Now turn your cheek 
 Just as you've been taught 
 For it is you 
 That I blaspheme 
 You are my never healing sore 
 A cancer, that I can't seem to shake 
 You are my never healing sore 
 A cancer, that I can't seem to shake 
 You are my never healing sore 
 A cancer, that I can't seem to shake 
 You are my never healing sore 
 A cancer, that I can't seem to shake...
########### Absolute Hell ###########
Imagine opening your eyes to a world defiled (to a world defiled) 
 A black, scorched earth 
 And a blood-filled sky 
 This is nothing more than a fascination 
 An extremely morbid infatuation 
 This is the end of humanity existing 
 Painful to say, but we had this coming 
 In this absolute hell 
 Is where I thrive 
 In this absolute hell 
 Is where I feel alive 
 In this absolute hell 
 Is where I thrive 
 In this absolute hell 
 Is where I feel alive 
 Feel alive 
 Cities will crumble 
 And the world's worst will become humble 
 It seems today is the day that you will die 
 So tell me how you feel about your life 
 Now imagine everything you love 
 Engulfed in fire 
 Hopes and dreams are melting 
 To the devil's choir 
 In this absolute hell 
 Is where I thrive 
 In this absolute hell 
 Is where I feel alive 
 In this absolute hell 
 Is where I thrive 
 In this absolute hell 
 Is where I feel alive 
 I can tell you 
 That I will embrace the end 
 Consider my journey fulfilled 
 Everything was all worth while 
 And as I gently smile 
 I become one with a world defiled 
 As I gently smile 
 I become 
 I become one with a world defiled 
 Become one with a world defiled

 Allegiance proven through and through 
 We are forever 
 It would be a disservice

 After all you have done for me 
 You all deserve this 
 We stand at each other's side

 We give the shirts off our backs, we'll give you everything 
 Giving each other a reason to live 
 But only for our own, but only for our own 
 This is for you, my beloved, my blood 
 The ones that I hold dear 
 This is for you, my brothers, my blood 
 The ones that I would die for 
 Times will change 
 People will too 
 This is my ode to you, to always stay true 
 No matter the roads that lie ahead 
 You will never be a weight that's too heavy to carry 
 No matter the roads that lie ahead 
 You will never be a weight that's too heavy to carry

 I shared my world 
 Now drag me through your hell 
 I showed you all I had 
 Now drag me through your hell 
 Feed the pigs 
 I told you she's a knockout 
 Shackled by the sound of your voice 
 But it's the one thing that's keeping me alive 
 Call off the wedding and cancel the band 
 Tell the caterers to feed the pigs 
 Your words sting like 
 Bullets going through me 
 If only they loaded this gun 
 I told you she's a knockout 
 You've buried yourself in lies 
 You've buried yourself now 
 Destroy the bonds that you have tied 
 Destroy the paths that you have cleared 
 Burn the bridges that you have built 
 Burn this city

I'm getting something off my chest 
 See I never liked your religion organized 
 I've learned to keep my mouth shut 
 I've learned to hold my tongue 
 But this has gone way too far 
 How can you preach unity while practicing segregation? 
 He's never coming, no resurrections 
 He's never coming because he did not exist 
 I believe what I believe 
 So don't force your faith on me 
 We're in this world together 
 Saints or sinners, it makes no difference 
 I'm free to speak my mind 
 Because nothing is sacred 
 You add to our decline 
 While holding the hand of God 
 You add to our decline 
 While holding the hand of God 
 Faith is just a crutch to lean on 
 So fear what you don't know 
 You're just blinding yourself 
 With false security 
 Living a life of lies 
 I hope you take offense to this 
 You have passed judgment on me 
 Now I'm judging you
########### I, Blaspheme ###########
It seems I am the anti-christ 
 It seems I am the devil's child 
 One look and it is clear to see 
 This is a mockery I was sent to poison your minds 
 Denounce you faith and exploit the lies. 
 Just take one look and its clear to see 
 The only one laughing is me 
 I've followed in those foot steps 
 I've strayed from that broken path 
 You are my never healing soar 
 A cancer I can't seem to shake 
 Seething, breathing 
 Swarming, transforming 
 I'm merely here to speak no lies 
 Shed some light and open some eyes. 
 Not all of us are born with an open mind 
 And some are bred into unfair lives. 
 You are my never healing soar 
 A cancer that I can't seem to shake [x2] 
 It seems everyone is out to criticize 
 All your judging will lead to your demise 
 I'll never be the one to watch my 
 Words I will never be silenced 
 I live to get a rise out of you 
 All this is a mockery you're wasting your time 
 Focusing your hate on me 
 I'm just a man 
 Now turn your cheek just as you have been taught 
 For it is you that I blaspheme you are my never healing soar 
 A cancer that I can't seem to shake [x2]
########### Solace ###########
The luster is now gone 
 I know where I belong 
 A vagabond by nature 
 A life only I can endure 
 I find solace, I find peace 
 I find peace in the unforeseen. 
 And now my satisfaction is achieved. 
 Welcome filth, accept uncertainty. 
 Comfort in knowing 
 I am not alone. 
 Passion is shared 
 Hardships endured. 
 Learn from this, and fucking grow. 
 Grow. live, eat, breathe, bleed 
 Striving to reach the peak. 
 Sweat, grind, break, bleed 
 Satisfaction achieved. 
 I find solace, I find peace 
 I find peace in the unforeseen. 
 And now my satisfaction is achieved. 
 This is a statement 
 To always try 
 This is a statement 
 To never die. 
 Now I boldly say 
 I can never die. 
 Live, eat, breathe, bleed 
 Striving to reach the peak. 
 Sweat, grind, break, bleed 
 Striving to reach the peak. 
 Fuck the impending 
 The condescending. 
 This is what I live by 
 A testament to always try. 
 Defy, defy, defy, defy. 
 I can never die. never die 
 Always strive 
 Never deny 
 I was built 
 To survive

Woke up this morning and decided 
 Today wasn't good enough 
 So tonight I'm drinking for all the wrong reasons 
 Destruction at its best 
 As I point the bottle to the sky 
 I find what I've been looking for this whole time 
 As I point the bottle to the sky 
 I find what I've been looking for this whole time 
 I've really brought the best out in me 
 Or so I thought 
 As I remember why today wasn't good enough 
 Good enough 
 As I point the bottle to the sky 
 I find what I've been looking for my whole life 
 All went black in an instant 
 The sun poured down on me 
 And all I could repeat 
 Through my throbbing mind 
 All I could repeat

All around there are never ending barriers surrounding 
 But I choose to search for any sign of you… 
 I'm losing hold on my faith 
 As the distance between keeps growing 
 I'm torn between my belief and reality 
 Pulled down, bound by gravity 
 I attempt to free myself 
 I will see the end of it, all this suffering 
 Purging all the pain inside me 
 Looking out upon the Earth 
 I hear your voice calling me into the sea… 
 Diving into darkness, leaving everything behind 
 Through the depths of many waters, I won't stop until you I find.

Wait for daybreak... 
 and it will swiftly come at last 
 the storm will calm 
 and in the stillness 
 arms open wide 
 to the prospect of new light 
 Falling away

 through the hourglass 
 leaving a trace of the answers left be 
 How can i awake 
 with no promise of tomorrow? 
 This portrait world i view 
 can't be all there is to see 
 So i wait for a crack in time 
 To open up and consume me 
 with darkness as my guide 
 bringing a path to light 
 The echoes of voices now resound 
 (I hear a familiar cry) 
 Cut the ties that bound us to...

########### The Great Escape ###########
We feel their eyes 
 Peering around ever corner 
 Those who held us captive for so long 
 Now they attempt to erase 
 And cover up our memory 
 Don’t let them in 
 They want to take what we believe 
 We have to escape 
 We have to get out now 
 Before they close in and take us away 
 Sleeping in forever unknown 
 If we stay we’ll never be safe 
 In darkness 
 Why can’t I return from this lifeless 
 Soul that keeps us from the light 
 In darkness 
 Why can’t I return from this lifeless 
 Soul that keeps us from the light 
 I replay all of the pictures in my head 
 Holding onto what I know to be 
 I swear they’ll never invade 
 And take away anything 
 They want to take what we believe 
 We have to escape… 
 We have to get out now 
 Before they close in and take us away 
 Sleeping in forever unknown 
 If we stay we’ll never be safe

Don't let these words of regret 
 Break apart our last breathe 
 This is the proving ground 
 Show me that you believe 
 This is our time 
 Believe that these attempts were not in vain 
 Show me that you believe 
 The we can reach enlightened skies 
 Shot down by the arrows of their lies 
 Our souls will elevate life 
 In the hands of all that we know and love 
 Lies a path for ways to uncover a 
 Memorandum of our fallen dreams 
 Don't give up now 
 Its just one step to the end 
 And I never we were so close to the edge 
 But as we stare into the horizon I swear to you 
 This day will not be in vain 
 From the ashes we rebuild and rectify lives once lost 
 But now reborn we find our place and rise above the rest 
 And together we will rise as one 
 Reborn from the ashes 
 And as we breach the skies 
 We will find true harmony 
 In the hands of all that we know and love 
 Lies a path for ways to uncover a 
 Memorandum of our fallen dreams 
 Don't give up now 
 It's just one step to the end

Arrows fall 
 Showering over our blinded eyes 
 The promise of tomorrow 
 Forgotten and unkempt 
 But in our darkest hour 
 Light shines through 
 The curtain of our souls 
 Give our eyes to light, sunlight brings new motivation 
 Bring our hearts to life, and awake us from our own temptations 
 Let the sky fall down to Earth 
 Cleansing away all this fury 
 Free your mind now this day is gone 
 A new foundation, a chance to start again 
 Let it shine through the night 
 Don’t let it fall away 
 In your sights, hold on tight 
 Keep it close until the end 
 Bring me back to dreams I once knew… 
 Give our eyes to light, sunlight brings new motivation 
 Bring our hearts to life, and awake us from our own temptations

 The eclipse comes to thrill the world 
 And darkness takes its place 
 The eclipse comes to this world 
 And I feel so strange 
 My soul and so far living souls 
 Start crying, why I miss you sun 
 When the light becomes so weak

 When darkness becomes so strong 
 And nothing is lit 
 When the stars became so small

 Thousands shall drown at the second 
 Of his darkest tide arise 
 Those who're left shall pray 
 No frail prayer will be heard 
 Thou shalt be the sacrifices 
 To the ancient god that comes 
 And our horde will purge this land 
 For the majesty of death! 
 I'm the master and the slave 
 I dwell in dreams of Realm 
 Though I exist in human shell 
 Do not be fooled o worms of flesh

 One day he'll use my deadly might 
 Pain a seathe and blood I thirst 
 The day he'll come I know I'll feast

 Endarment, all love and meaning 
 And strength . . 
 Have left this reality 
 Weeping of water may have same cost 
 I'm lost in reflections of the silence 
 who am I? It looks like I woke up 
 I'm the soul that lived in the past 
 Distruction of reality 
 Distruction of my mind 
 Sword turned the rust 
 Earth is disdain of blood 
 This is the beginning of the end 
 I'm the soul that has died in the past 
 All I can see is just a dust 
 In this damned world

 It was lost in me 
 My soul was vulnerable and wretched after that 
 I've been able to murder all 
 I knew, that hurt, ahh, me in the past

 And now I need no revenge 
 Everything is in balance 
 Release, from nothing came this all 
 I find release of detestation 
 That percolate through my soul

 And now I need no revenge 
 I reached the equipoise 
 Release, to nothing's gone this all

 Stupid competence

 Venomous, ubiquitous mist

 Mist is only a gost

 Majestic precipice 
 You're so splendid, and strong

 This marvel was looking stare 
 I am realizing my folly 
 recklessness . . . 
 I can't repress my restless attraction 
 To this unbounded precipice 
 I'm standing at option 
 Involved in thunder of my convulsive thoughts 
 I can't put down my restive aspiration 
 For this unbounded steep 
 I'm feel the queer surge of energy 
 My senses become untwined

 Like water's pliant 
 Like earth's strength

 Cold, dark, obscure 
 Bleakness is surrounding me

 Burning 
 Like the sun 
 Blameless 
 And in my 
 Eyes she is a masterpiece 
 In my soul distress 
 Madness and dark

 Rage, overcrowding wrath

 Here the church devastation 
 Like just another crow, in the sky 
 See it's obscure, feel it's dead 
 Oh haunted... 
 I came here to fall into oblivion 
 I came there to feel my inspiration, my purgatory 
 The church proclaimed 
 Accursed damned in dust and filth 
 Pierced dishonest devil 
 So this is the place for me I penetrate in 
 The church proclaimed 
 The rise of obliteration 
 Crowded destructive evil 
 Here is the place for me 
 Obliteration, commence!
########### I Am Of Night ###########
When I will be on the edge of madness 
 I'll see the truth of the perfection 
 But price will be a lonely sadness 
 As I will see the world's destruction 
 I traveled to the sun and back 
 I strived to purify my filth 
 But I got nothing from the light 
 It burns in wrath, it cannot heal 
 Deny the evil chaos 
 Deny the sun's destructive rays 
 And with the fall of dark 
 Your sins will truly sweep away 
 I'm foolish, mankind I can't see 
 Perfection I am seeking for 
 In night I'll find my sanctuary 
 Beyond the light of moon 
 The darkness will absorb my pain 
 For lovely kiss I'll give to her 
 Deny the evil flint 
 Deny the sun's igneous face 
 And with abrouse of night 
 Your sins will truly sweep away
########### Tended High ###########
The sun rejected me 
 I was sad of this 
 I felt the might of church 
 Oblivious influence 
 I was in ire 
 I was denied 
 I was in yearning 
 It was impetous 
 Completely broken 
 I was razed to the ground 
 Oh vehement my spirit 
 Which way you rush 
 Defenseless like a dreamer 
 I try to comprehend 
 Am I exhausted 
 Of this so much square thought 
 Can't crawl with ignoramus 
 I'm tended high 
 Feel in ocean 
 It open to me 
 Breath, get wairds 
 The scruples slept 
 Nothing can deny 
 Rainy solitude in my heart 
 I still remember 
 That moments mesmerized 
 Which suddenly gone 
 And turned the pain 
 I will never rich this pitch 
 Of emotions any more 
 My spirit fall...

 Crawl as you fade, and we feel the earth come down

Giants came 
 They were smaller than the seas, so were all the same

 If we stand taller their relevance is unclear 
 When will it appear? 
 Giants came 
 They had blood between their lines, hung from their name 
 Silence came 
 No sound no nothing, giants to blame 
 And we might wonder why theyre here

########### ...Of What You Were Missing ###########
When I was young I used to think I had it all figured out: 
 The physical didn't lie, and the lies I knew were true 
 Fed on that common set of beliefs that my school 
 Then my job, and a little routine would be my everything 
 But when I started to reflect on my own passions 
 Something inside me started to cry 
 All of a sudden everything in the physical was just a mirage 
 And I knew the only thing which was forever real was already inside of me 
 No more compromising with the material world 
 Meeting the demands of those living as ghosts 
 Not in this lifetime would I watch from the sidelines 
 As my true ambitions would be silenced 
 I knew that the only thing that was forever real was already inside of me 
 I was my essence 
 My Soul 
 I will not fall victim to your will. 
 I will not fall victim to your ways. 
 This flesh and bone is just a fraction of what we are 
 This flesh and bone is just a fraction of what we are

 CAN'T YOU SEE THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO

########### Why? ###########
Since you were born you watched TV 
 cartoons with violence and greed 
 in your world all that was OK 
 your parents never taught you right 
 from wrong, brother taught you to fight 
 Now it's time to show them what you've got 
 Time to show them what you've got 
 An attitude, a fancy car 
 your buddies got your back 
 your parents' house compared to yours 
 looks something like a shack 
 in your thirty seven guns 
 the bullets painted red 
 a simple stare is all it takes 
 to fill 'em up with lead but 
 Why, are you acting like you're someone else? 
 Why, can't you stop thinking about yourself 
 Last friday night you went driving 
 a stolen car and golden rings 
 it was something you just had to do 
 your little friends the cops caught you 
 you're sentenced for a long time 
 now tell me what you're gonna do 
 in a world where no one cares 
 labels i don't want to wear 
 i had a dream that i could once walk 
 safely in the streets 
 you've got to take it away from me 
 Why, are you acting like you're someone else? 
 Why, can't you stop thinking about yourself
########### Go Away ###########
Won't you understand 
 that we don't give a shit what you demand 
 your values never meant anything to us 
 we don't give a shit 
 petitions signed, parents standing in a line 
 just to stop their kids who wanna hear 
 what we have to say 
 when you were a little younger 
 your dream was to become a rocker 
 now it seems that it's what you hate 
 i never will 
 go to hell 
 it's what my friends want me to tell 
 what you do is what i hate 
 i hate you 
 Go away, i don't want you on my tape 
 Go away, i don't want you in my face 
 Go away i don't want you on my tape 
 fuck the pmrc 
 tipper won't you understand 
 the message that i want to say 
 it's kind of rude but here it goes it's fuck you 
 i don't like what you do 
 and i don't like you 
 Go away, i don't want you on my tape 
 Go away, i don't want you in my face 
 fuck the pmrc
########### I'm A Man ###########
I CANNOT BELIEVE 
 ALL THE THINGS YOU SAY TO ME 
 WHAT ABOUT LAST NIGHT 
 I WAS NICE WHY'D YOU DECIEVE ME 
 I BROUGHT YOU HOME AND I CAME IN 
 I WASN'T THERE FOR A CONVERSATION 
 I WANTED YOU AND ME IN BED 
 BUT YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
 WHEN YOU REALIZED MY INTENTIONS 
 YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU DIDN'T CARE 
 (OR YOU WERE JUST TOO SCARED) 
 ALL I DID WAS SCREAM 
 AND BROKE YOUR HARMLESS LITTLE HAND CUZ I'M A MAN 
 I HAVE TO PROVE TO EVERYONE 
 THAT I CAN HAVE YOU WHEN I WANT 
 AND YOU'LL NOD YOUR HEAD IN VAIN 
 I'M A MAN 
 I HAVE TO PROVE TO EVERYONE 
 THAT I CAN CHEAT ON YOU AGAIN 
 WHY ARE YOU AFRAID? 
 IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN (IT WILL) 
 YOU KNOW I'D NEVER HIT A FRIEND 
 I BROUGHT YOU FLOWERS BOUGHT YOU CANDY

In his childhood memories 
 a belt and bruises 
 he thought he could forget 
 the times he had abused him 
 promises made to himself 
 that he would never hit 
 anybody else 
 all that he wanted was 
 love from he who brought them up but 
 he just could not understand 
 he brought his friends home just to 
 make sure he was not alone cuz 
 dad was a violent man 
 every night he goes to sleep 
 but he's not lonely 
 he's got a wife and kids 
 and a promise that he can't keep 
 past memories he can't forget 
 the dad he had become 
 was a dad that made his children sad 
 all that they wanted was 
 love from he who brought them up but 
 he just could not understand 
 they brought their friends home just to 
 make sure he was not alone cuz 
 dad was a violent man 
 beaten up he beats his son 
 when something turn out wrong 
 he screams so hard he blows a lung 
 past memories he can't forget 
 the promise he had made 
 it just turned out to be a lie 
 that's not what you deserve...

 THEM FROM THEIR MISERY BUT 
 MADE THEM SLAVES

 GONE TO WASTE 
 GIVE THEM A LITTLE LAND

########### A Matter Of Rights ###########
She lived silently in a house near the countryside 
 Her parents knew that it was better there 
 And just like every week she'd go to town that second day 
 She didn't know that he'd be waiting there 
 He stole the one thing that she kept untouched so long 
 Stealing her virginity just made him feel so strong 
 And all the stupid things he'd done so many times 
 No one can forgive him 'cause it's crime 
 Forcing him self into her she tries to scream for help 
 There's no one close enough to hear her cry 
 At the time she didn't think of what was coming next 
 But she was stuck with that unwanted child 
 Her country knew about it 
 But didn't care about her life 
 Their stupid right wing values 
 Got her life turned upside down 
 "You've got yourself in this mess 
 The kid is now part of your life!" 
 "Tell me would you say the same thing 
 If our roles were switched around?" 
 Begging for abortion her human rights are still denied 
 The child inside her wasn't supposed to be there 
 The right wing says: 
 It's the child or death yeah 
 She's got to run away her life is a mess 
 He stole the one thing that she kept untouched so long 
 Stealing her virginity just made him feel so strong 
 And all the stupid things he'd done so many times 
 No one can forgive him 'cause it's crime 
 Her country knew about it 
 But didn't care about her life 
 Their stupid right wing values 
 Got her life turned upside down 
 "You've got yourself in this mess 
 The kid is now part of your life!" 
 "Tell me would you say the same thing 
 If our roles were switched around?"

First time you met me you shook my hand 
 But you looked the other way 
 The values you cherish contradict every word you say 
 Look at me 
 We're all the same 
 There is no one to blame 
 If our skins have different shades 
 We're all of a kind 
 It's all in your mind 
 So please put down your blades 
 Stop making fun of everyone 
 That doesn't look like you 
 Or all those years of suffering 
 Will fall back down on you 
 Like a deck of cards 
 We're different kinds 
 But still we're all the same 
 We're in this together 
 And there's nothing you can say 
 Now it is time 
 To lose all the lies 
 That people give to you 
 It's time to react 
 Time to fight back 
 Together for the truth 
 You're living in your little world 
 And there is hatred in your eyes 
 But that hatred still remains unjustified 
 If different skinshade is anomalous 
 Which one is right 
 United we stand tall 
 Divided we will fall 
 You and I both know that we can live together 
 All it takes is time and we can get there 
 It's time to lose that fascist racist state of mind 
 I want to hear you say 
 United we stand tall, divided we will fall!
########### I Know ###########
Tell me when 
 You knew everything 
 I can't even remember yesterday

 here feels right 
 This life feels like a twisted T.V. show 
 That I don't know 
 I'm not a walking commercial 
 My life is not a rehearsal 
 I'm not looking for the perfect answer 
 You should open up my mind 
 To things I haven't yet 
 seen in my dreams 
 Your part of them now 
 I don't know how 
 Some might say I don't fit in 
 I never wanted to 
 You and I we don't fit in

 No it's not too late 
 No it's not the right time 
 To cross the gate invisible line 
 Established by mankind 
 Our planet is abused 
 Can't live this was any more,

########### My Dream And I ###########
With Everyday that goes by 
 It sure gets lonely in this... this world of mine 
 This state of nothingness keeps on eating me 
 Will I succeed? 
 I can't help but wonder 
 What chapter is the next 
 I think I can't stop thinking 
 My mind just needs a rest 
 Has Everyone around me has lost their mind? 
 Need to think I'm crazy cause I'm real 
 I Don't have to think 
 It's under my skin 
 No one can stop my dream and I 
 I can't sleep 
 I'm in too deep 
 These odds are scaring me away 
 If you don't understand 
 Seems like no one can 
 Am I insane 
 Am I to blame 
 It seems everyday I lose more inspiration 
 I'm out of motivation 
 My life is going nowhere 
 With everyday that goes by 
 It sure gets lonely in this... this world of mine 
 I WILL SUCCEED!! 
 I WILL SUCCEED!! 
 I Don't have to think

 No one can stop my dream and iiiiiiiiiii 
 I Don't have to think

########### Let Me Go ###########
I've grown a lot in the past five years 
 You've helped me out through all my fears 
 You're there for me when ever I'm in need 
 But now your eyes are filled with tears 
 Because your afraid I'll disappear you're just 
 Scared that I don't want you here 
 And I don't want you near 
 I'm growing up like everyone 
 Soon you'll be all alone 
 I know how hard it is to be alone 
 For so long you've held me close 
 Under protection of your wing 
 Never thinking of this day 
 Now your afraid I might not remember 
 All the things you taught me 
 In eighteen years 
 So when I say this please remember 
 That you mean the whole world to me 
 But you're gonna have to try to let me go 
 You've got to learn to let me go now 
 Let me go you've got to learn to let me go 
 Last night when you told me that you thought 
 You lost my love 
 I couldn't figure who you were thinking of 
 Some one new just took my love 
 No need to fall apart 
 Cause I still feel the same 
 Don't go out to play tonight 
 Don't go out to bars there's 
 Too many fights there 
 I can't stand this waiting in the 
 Dark for you again 
 But when I get back home tonight you'll be 
 Waiting there just like last night 
 I know that some time again you will love me 
 But I can't read your mind so please understand 
 That the cards are in my hands 
 And you can't be the judge in my life 
 It's complicated enough already sometimes 
 You might believe that I'm on strike 
 But please let me choose my own path 
 Let me go you have to learn to 
 Let me go now let me go 
 My heart still needs some time to grow
########### Pressure ###########
vers1: 
 Everyone is staring 
 Down at me again 
 Something's lacking 
 My friends 
 Never let me in 
 I feel the pressure 
 Pushing me 
 It's pushing me again 
 I can't take much more 
 Not any more, 
 Not any more I feel 
 That I've been pushed and 
 Held again the wall 
 No one, knew 
 How I felt inside 
 I feel, the walls are 
 Falling down 
 Inside my mind 
 I need, some time 
 To get away 
 Why can't anyone 
 Just listen 
 Leave me all alone 
 How come no one 
 Understands me 
 Leave me all alone (Leave me all alone)

########### The End ###########
Every time I see you 
 Your trying so hard 
 Selling a part of your soul 
 The clock on the wall 
 Says your not 
 Far from your goal 
 You'll just have to 
 Wait and see 
 Now it's not a 
 Question of time 
 You'll have to 
 Face your fear 
 Your hate, and fight 
 Till the end, 
 Every time I see you 
 Your trying so hard 
 Trying so hard 
 But no one cares 
 You'll hate to 
 Learn to trust 
 No one but yourself 
 And always believe
########### What Now? ###########
Woke up in someone else bed 
 He can't remember what she said 
 So he ran away again so what now 
 He's got hair that's failing off his head 
 The teacher really wants him dead 
 But he never really cared about that 
 I don't think anyone will ever understand 
 Mom and dad won't even hold his hand 
 He's got a problem with authority 
 So what now 
 I can see tonight she's all alone 
 He really wants to take her home 
 And he really hoped that she would like that 
 He can't get a number for the phone 
 He doesn't even have a home 
 But he never really cared about that 
 I don't think that anyone will ever understand 
 Mom and dad won't even hold his hand 
 He's got a problem with authority
########### Blew It Off ###########
No, still don't know 
 How he fucked it up again 
 Lost it in the end 
 It was all your fault 
 Why am I such a lucky guy 
 To think we could have died 
 Could someone pinch me I'm alive 
 Blew it off again 
 You lost it in the end 
 There's nothing you can do 
 We can laugh about it now 
 Some days I ask myself why 
 We're still alive 
 Six whole days and five whole nights of 
 Chaotic hell but tonight 
 I'm feeling fine 
 We suffered three of four breakdowns 
 The snow and wind whipped us around 
 A holiday 
 We'll never find our way
########### Wide Open ###########
Open 
 Open up your mind 
 Stand up straight 
 And everything will be fine 
 I know you've been alone 
 For a while and you 
 Thought that it would last 
 You've got to concentrate 
 And forget about the past 
 I know the pain 
 Your going through 
 But it's only passing by 
 And I know the pain 
 Your going through 
 But please remember 
 That any time 
 You can come my way 
 It's your fault 
 It's my fault 
 Who cares 
 Lets do it all again
########### Big Brother ###########
Searching for the truth 
 Where should I look around 
 The T.V. channels can't 
 Stop going round and round 
 Pathetic shows 
 There all controlled 
 Big Brothers changed the sounds 
 We all know the 
 Right wing pay the crowd 
 He's watching you now 
 Suddenly I've notices that it's not a game 
 We're so well programmed 
 That everybody thinks the same 
 And I can't take it 
 There's so much more to understand 
 So much information kept in 
 Government hands 
 I won't accept it anymore 
 You can't show that on T.V. 
 Reflects too much reality 
 Don't want anyone to know 
 What's really going on 
 Don't want to know what's going on 
 Don't want to know what's going on 
 Going on 
 Going on
########### Friend ###########
We started off, a little while ago 
 We built this little boat 
 And set it off to sea 
 Then we brought a friend along the way 
 We decided he would stay 
 Stay with you and me 
 Bought some sticks 
 And put them in your hands 
 I taught you how to stand 
 I taught you everything 
 I opened up your mind to something new 
 And now it something you can use 
 You don't have to thank me 
 But don't expect me, to be smiling 
 When we meet again 
 I think you'll understand 
 I don't think I want to be your friend 
 Now there's only one solution 
 And of course you jump to conclusions 
 And you can count how much we owe you 
 But you just lost something much greater 
 You just lost your best friend 
 So don't expect me, to be smiling 
 When we meet again 
 I think you'll understand 
 I don't think I want to be your friend 
 You had your chance, you did not change 
 We took our future, in our own hands 
 This is no game, I will not wait 
 I can't wait for you to change now 
 You had your chance, you did not change 
 We took our future, in our own hands 
 This is no game, I will not wait 
 I can't wait for you to change now
########### Double Cross ###########
When we first met you took my hand 
 And I'll never understand 
 Why you changed so drastically 
 Did you really think I would 
 Let myself get stepped on by someone as low as you 
 Now it's time for you to pay for your lies 
 Some day you might understand 
 Sometimes it's easier to deny 
 Than see your own lies, look at yourself 
 You will not forget me when I'm gone 
 Things have changed yet it's still same 
 Only the memories remain 
 And you can't push them away 
 Don't you feel ashamed 
 I guess you never thought it would end up in such a mess 
 Now it's time for you to pay for your lies 
 I never felt so fucking cheated 
 Cause your leaving with a part of me 
 I'll never find again 
 My confidence in people 
 And wonderful feeling of being safe 
 When I'm alone 
 Did you really think I would 
 Let myself get stepped on by someone as low as you 
 You'll pay for your lies 
 I'm coming back again 
 You had better start shaking some hands 
 Cause you'll be living on command 
 I'd like to see you some day walking in my shoes 
 And see if you could last 
 Don't cry about the past
########### Choke ###########
I don't think you understand 
 I do not think you comprehend 
 What's in my mind 
 I don't know if you realize 
 The consequences of your lies 
 And in the end 
 I don't think you realize 
 There's got to be a light in the end 
 No one can tell if it was planned 
 You understand 
 There's got to be a light in the end 
 I don't want to be involved 
 I've never asked to be a part of this 
 There's got to be a light in the end 
 No one can tell me 
 What the fuck is this
########### Picture Perfect ###########
I wanted to be your friend 
 I needed to hold your hand 
 And when its time to say goodbye 
 Take a picture in your mind 
 Everything's zen 
 Everything's right 
 And when its time I hate to say goodbye 
 Take a picture in your mind 
 Everything's zen 
 Everything's right
########### Virtuality ###########
Welcome to a new dimension 
 Where things are not the same 
 A world without limitation 
 Where life is not a game 
 Breathe and experience now 
 A new way of living 
 Welcome to a revolution 
 Where life can be explained 
 I don't if I will survive inside 
 'Cause sometimes virtuality 
 Might strike, it might strike 
 I don't know if I'm really strong enough 
 And face something virtual 
 I feel like I've never felt before 
 A feeling that I cannot describe 
 And yet again 
 'Cause I feel like I've been but in my place 
 A feeling that I cannot describe 
 And yet again 
 Follow the new dimension 
 Where people aren't the same 
 A world without regulation 
 Surviving's not a game 
 Breathe and experience now 
 A new way of living 
 Welcome to a revolution 
 Where life can be explained
########### Moonlight ###########
I just can't believe 
 I just wanna breathe 
 Take a second of your precious time 
 Close your eyes 
 I'll bring you to paradise 
 Have you ever danced 
 With the devil in the night 
 Close your eyes 
 I'll bring you to paradise 
 I'll take you to paradise 
 I just can't believe 
 Politicians lead a vast 
 Campaign of horror 
 Close your eyes 
 I'll bring you to paradise 
 I'll take you to paradise 
 Have you ever danced 
 With the devil in the night 
 In a pale moonlight 
 Close your eyes 
 I'll bring you to paradise 
 I'll take you to paradise

Sometimes it's got to be obnoxious 
 Realize everytime we have to draw the line 
 Last chance to make a change and so on 
 No one can deny these lines 
 No one can deny what's been said and done 
 We can't predict, no one can 
 Everytime we've got to draw the line 
 Now it's time to sing Ratify
########### Sky And Skull ###########
Sparks in your eyes 
 And I wonder why 
 Hiding deep inside 
 The back of my mind 
 The stars in the sky 
 Like sparks in your eyes 
 Hiding deep inside 
 The back of my mind 
 Everytime that I make you smile 
 I see something real in your eyes 
 All this time you made me realize 
 I still can't deny girl of my life 
 You're the girl of my life and please realize 
 You've got to open your eyes 
 I think it's time now 
 It's time to realize 
 The plan we have in mind 
 Look at the sky 
 What can you find? 
 I'm still searching 
 To be breathing again 
 Tears in your eyes 
 I must emphasize; 
 You've got something that I would like in the end 
 You've got to be the one in my life
########### Eyeball ###########
Look into the eyeball my friend 
 Precious man can't you understand 
 Look into the eyeball 
 Tell me what can you see 
 What can't you see 
 You keep it going on

########### Free Fall ###########
God I don't know why you're feeling this way 
 You've got to fucking open up your mind 
 'Cause I don't feel a thing 
 I wish that you'd be with me 
 I wish that you could see that I'm something 
 I'm not (the man I am) 
 I wish that you'd be then sing here with me 
 I wish that you'd be dancing here with me 
 'Cause life is not a game 
 I'm falling down

########### Amnesia ###########
I can't remember what she said 
 Last night it's in my head 
 I can't remember a word she said 
 Last night we were in bed 
 I can't remember a word she said 
 I can't keep on going on 
 One step closer to your grave 
 One step closer to your grave 
 One step closer to your grave 
 Your one step closer to your grave 
 No one can help me anymore 
 Nothing can save me now 
 I'm drowning 
 Feels like I'm under water 
 I can't get back on top 
 Struggling to find a breath of air
########### Untitled ###########
Conscious again 
 Feels like the end 
 You can hardly speak up now 
 You're stomach is empty 
 Has been for a while 
 There's just one thing on your mind 
 Can't you see you're out of line? 
 You've lost all your friends 
 In just one blink 
 But everything's fine 
 You've lost yourself respect 
 Yeah you've lost yourself 
 As you reach for the needle now 
 You love your medicine 
 Tomorrow 
 And yesterdays seem all the same 
 You're just lost somewhere inside 
 Oh yeah that sensation again 
 Everyone here.... ??? 
 You've lost all your friends 
 In just one blink 
 But everything's fine 
 You've lost yourself respect 
 Yeah you've lost yourself 
 Which drags you down, down, down 
 This fucking medicine 
 This fucking medicine
########### Corrupted To The Bone ###########
Every time that you can't sleep 
 Every time you're in disbelief 
 I don't think that you can understand 
 I won't pretend, I won't apologize 
 And I'll make you realize 
 Uncle Sam's atrocious master plan 
 It's plain fucking insane 
 Welcome to this world 
 Welcome to a brand new world 
 The statue we call liberty 
 Is the statue of the hypocrisy 
 I'm so sick of this shit 
 Maybe it will never end 
 In the land of opportunity 
 So cry for democracy 
 Every time that you can't breathe 
 Every line you cannot read 
 I don't think that you dare to understand 
 My name is my band and it makes me sick 
 Fuck all your rhetoric 
 The angels will claim your corrupted soul 
 Corrupted to the bone 
 Welcome to our world 
 Welcome to a better world 
 The statue of our liberty 
 Is the symbol of the hypocrisy 
 I'm so sick of this shit 
 Maybe it will never end 
 In the land of opportunity 
 So cry for democracy 
 Welcome to this world 
 Welcome to a brand new world 
 The statue we call liberty 
 Is the statue of the hypocrisy 
 I'm so sick of this shit 
 Tell me will it ever end? 
 In the land of opportunity 
 So scream for democracy
########### Sadness And Sorrow ###########
I've got an open mind 
 Man, I can't stand what you can't comprehend 
 The importance of the message behind these lines 
 You're paralyzed 
 You know I can tell by the looks on your face 
 Dark sorrow and sadness displayed 
 Fight for your life 
 Cry until you die 
 You can't tell what to feel 
 Hell, you don't what it means 
 Why, why can't you try? 
 I wish I could cure all this pain that you have 
 Go back in time and change the past 
 No, it won't last 
 You're facing a fact that you cannot deny 
 You have to stop living in the past 
 Scarred for life 
 I'm scared for you to cry 
 You can't tell what it means 
 Hell, you don't know how it feels 
 I wish I could cure all this pain that you have 
 Go back in time and change the past 
 No, it won't last 
 You're facing a fact that you cannot deny 
 You have to stop living in the past
########### No Intensity ###########
Have you seen my life 
 Falling down from beyond? 
 Have you seen my life 
 That is a shadow of my past? 
 Can't seem to find the answers hiding deep inside 
 Feels like a vicious circle toying with my brain 
 I can't see through this battery 
 I need relief instantly 
 Follow your own philosophy 
 Yet I feel no intensity 
 Have you seen my life 
 Is changing all so fast? 
 Have you seen my life 
 That is reflective of my past? 
 Can't seem to find the answers causing all this pain 
 Feels like a vicious circle driving me insane 
 I can't see through this battery 
 I need relief instantly 
 I won't embrace hypocrisy 
 And I feel no intensity
########### Communicate With Me ###########
Last I recall and I just can't believe 
 I cannot conceive 
 Can't blame everything on me 
 Tell me can't you see? 
 I do want to believe I never wanted to leave 
 But I left 'cause you left me no choice 
 And of course I heard your voice 
 You're wasting your time 
 Your sweet precious time 
 Seems you can't read between 
 Between these two lines 
 Why can't you see? 
 Why can't we agree 
 That patience will become the key? 
 Communicate with me 
 Why - why can't you see? 
 Why - why can't you see? 
 Time will run by 
 And we shall decide 
 If this is the end 
 Tell me can't you see? 
 I've always believed 
 We'll manage to achieve 
 But I left 'cause you left me no choice 
 And of course I heard your voice 
 You're wasting your time 
 Your sweet precious time 
 It seems you can't read between 
 And I must emphasize 
 I wish you'd understand 
 Why can't we agree 
 That patience will become the key? 
 Communicate with me 
 You're wasting your time 
 Blind bleeding the blind 
 It seems you can't read between 
 Between these two rhymes 
 Why can't you see? 
 Why can't we agree 
 That patience will become the key? 
 Communicate with me
########### Redemption ###########
My eyes, they can't believe these lies 
 We need to apologize 
 For everything we did 
 For every sin 
 Our leaders have been blinded 
 Propaganda of slavery 
 Hypocrisy against third world 
 Third world countries 
 We can't go on today abusing their lands 
 And think everything's alright 
 You know it's true 
 We can't go on this way 
 Exploiting all these lives 
 Your game has turned insane 
 Fuck, Bush, you suck 
 And I can't believe your lies 
 When you claim to represent 
 The interest of your country 
 Are you insane? 
 Behind your mask of shame, help me explain 
 Why so many people are now dead for no reason why 
 We can't go on today 
 Abusing their lands 
 And think everything's alright 
 You know it's true 
 We can't go on this way 
 Exploiting all these lives 
 Your game has turned insane 
 People of this world 
 Are dying in pain 
 Starving in vain 
 Can't find no WofMD's 
 No, it's not right 
 And if you think it sounds cliché 
 Think Iraq, Afghanistan 
 Iran and Pakistan, are they next to be destroyed? 
 We can't go on today abusing their lands 
 And think everything's alright 
 You know it's true 
 We can't go on this way 
 Exploiting all these lives 
 Your game has turned insane
########### Letter Go ###########
You could pick me up and make me fly 
 To a place that I don't know 
 And I'm terrified 
 At the thought that you might let go 
 So instead I'm the guy who won't try 
 And there's no point in saying I'm sorry 
 Cause there's no way you might 
 And I envy you for being so demanding 
 And I know all about you I miss you now 
 And there's no point in saying I'm sorry 
 Cause there's no way you might 
 Believe me at all 
 And I'm terrified 
 At the thought that you might let go 
 So instead I'm the guy who won't try 
 And there's no point in saying I'm sorry 
 Cause there's no way you might 
 Believe me at all 
 Believe me at all 
 Believe me at all
########### Better Days ###########
Every day I feel ashamed 
 It seems that I couldn't 
 Come across and realize 
 Now it's just too late 
 I thought I could just 
 Find a way to win you back 
 But now it seems 
 That it's too late 
 Better days have gone by 
 I don't know why 
 You and I until the end 
 Every night in my sleep 
 Your shadow keeps on coming back 
 I don't know why 
 Remember yesterday 
 When friends were there and nothing else would matter 
 Now it seems better days have gone by 
 Better days have gone by 
 I don't know why 
 You and I until the end 
 Now I know that life won't be the same 
 Nothing here remains 
 No future and no past 
 Tell me why no one can explain 
 The reason for this pain? 
 But you're not to blame 
 Until the end of time 
 The end of time…
########### Ground Zero ###########
Life's a game sometimes insane 
 Fragile is the innocence of mankind 
 What the fuck another plane falling from the sky 
 Death is now imminent no reason why 
 Death preachers have arrived you know that 
 We'll make no mistakes 
 Believers of corrupted billionaire leaders 
 Killing for religion 
 Is something I wouldn't recommend 
 Now I don't want to fear 
 What's coming next 
 What might be coming next? 
 Cause some of us will die 
 Dark days have passed 
 Friends are not forgotten 
 Anger turns to hate and fear, then again 
 No one can explain the reasons, motivation 
 Behind the tragic suicide 
 Of those kamikaze of death 
 The preachers of death, yeah 
 Some of us will die 
 No reason why 
 Death preachers have arrived you know that 
 We'll make no mistakes 
 Believers of corrupted billionaire leaders 
 Killing for religion 
 Is something I wouldn't recommend 
 Now I don't want to fear 
 This New World Order 
 That might be coming next

########### The Truth Ain't Kind ###########
Undeserved pain, 
 People proclaim, 
 "All will be good some day" 
 Try to forget, 
 Cease to regret, 
 Hide all my fears away. 
 Turn out the light, 
 Restart the fight 
 Inside my head again. 
 Can't I bring it to an end? 
 And here comes back reality. 
 Pushing my hopes away. 
 Leave the dream, 
 The dream of true security 
 And break down the same old way. 
 Don't use your brain, 
 Why go insane? 
 The truth ain't kind. 
 Live in a lie 
 Are we all too young to die? 
 Confess my sins, 
 Treatment begins, 
 The cross coming down on me. 
 Have to repent, 
 Father has sent angels. 
 Now evil flees. 
 Now back at home 
 TV has shown pictures of lies and war. 
 Father tell me, what's this for? 
 Can't you tell, tell me please!! 
 What's it for?
########### Why ###########
I can't fall asleep. 
 My visions make me cry 
 I ask myself. 
 Why am I here 
 Left in despair - no light 
 And there's no change 
 Why do we love 
 Right at the start and then - 
 We end in hate 
 Why do we have 
 Way enough food for all 
 But we don't share 
 Why does the sun end up in rain 
 Why does the shadow fall into the light. 
 And why is god out there 
 Where are his leading hands. 
 Why do we trust a godless church 
 Laughing at those who really seem to care. 
 And why is god out there 
 But no leading hands 
 Why am I here Can't close my eyes 
 Questions without answers to find. 
 Why am I here - lost in my fear 
 And no saving walls behind. 
 Why am I here 
 Can't close my eyes 
 Why am I here 
 Lost in my fear 
 Where is the healing hand 
 Embracing me and giving me the answers that I need. 
 Why am I here 
 Can't close my eyes. 
 Questions without answers to find. 
 Restless mind 
 Not willing to surrender 
 Never find solutions comprimised 
 It's just an endless game 
 (Whisper:) "When will I close my eyes" 
 Tell me ways to find Give me peace of mind. 
 Tell me ways to find Call me now! 
 Close my eyes!

########### Tomorrow's Eve ###########
Where are you now, 
 Where time chokes on madness 
 The truth is gone, a lie became real 
 You play the clown but people still trust you 
 The end is near and your grin fades away 
 Where is the light 
 (There's no light in these days of grey) 
 Where are you now, what do you feel, 
 There are you now, can't hide, 
 No wall of your lies. 
 Now you'll pay - No escape 
 Pay forever - and ever - and now 
 Hear the silence all around you. 
 Even your time has come. 
 The world is blind, 
 Just millions of phrases 
 Smile is hate, and features cheat 
 Your suit decays 
 But your mob still adores you 
 Your scummy slime, it fills human brains 
 They talk and talk till it's too late 
 With foolish words that veil our fate 
 But we shout with joy 'til the eve of life 
 Today is past, tomorrow's now. 
 Dream 'til the end and fear the row. 
 So what - Keep smilin' with your crazy faith
########### Hades ###########
Here comes your brand-new feeling 
 Life turns round. 
 Dark confusion kills your thoughts 
 And break you down. 
 There he lies in peace 
 Folded hands 
 His skin is grey and pale 
 So here it ends 
 There's just another heart to break 
 Another tear to cry 
 No one can help you in these days 
 When the ticking of the clock has passed you by. 
 When it's time to share out 
 True face shows. 
 Greed is turning inside out, 
 And friend to foe. 
 There he lies in peace 
 His name on stone 
 Grief's forgotten now 
 They sold his soul 
 There is just noones heart to break 
 No single tear to cry 
 You've got to help yourself these days 
 When the help that you have prayed for is denied
########### Escape From Reality ###########
Paralyzed brains 
 And anemic eyes that stare 
 At pictures so real 
 The visual banquet's near 
 There's no doubt: You taste it, you see it, 
 For the first time in your life 
 You hold the key to unknown pleasure. 
 Surrender and escape 
 And feed your mindless view 
 Submit your will To unknown dreams 
 -How pretty your life turns out 
 -No more recurring doubts. 
 And unholy thoughts on your mind- 
 Are left in the past 
 A world made for you 
 Superior life at last. 
 The cyberworld turns into real life 
 No more tears In a soulless land - 
 Your unknown world of pleasure. 
 The game is played so welcome back to reality. 
 But you won't see the difference any longer. 
 Did your will kill the fictions or did they kill you. 
 Don't mind - at least for a moment life's been your own. 
 The past... Past for you. A world made for you.
########### Dreamtime ###########
Let your worries fall away. 
 Turn off your mind and calm down inside 
 Now feel all the pictures you see... 
 Can't remember yesterday. 
 All I really know is the fear I felt inside. 
 And no hand to lead me through life 
 Look around Victim's found 
 Take it out on her 
 Why don't we have time for dreaming? 
 Restless live - A prophecy? 
 When sometimes I wake up screaming 
 Will my fears survive when I fall asleep again? 
 Fall asleep 
 Won't you dream with me - dream with me 
 Share this dream with me
########### Tainted Silence ###########
Same truth, same belief 
 One youth that chases many dreams, 
 Of peace and of eternity. 
 Then the world starts to rage 
 And life wants to rule - 
 Their love away and a void 
 Comes to spread all despair. 
 Then, when cries steal their dreams 
 And lies drink their tears 
 Then doubt rapes their faith 
 Ice is their way 
 When tainted silence surrounds their mind. 
 Life does not pay 
 For broken faith that's been raped by fear. 
 No truth, no belief 
 What have we done to our birds 
 Of hope and of eternity. 
 In a world full of rage 
 Where lie means success 
 Where hope must die. 
 And hate comes to blind their bright eyes. 
 "Close your eyes and dream with me 
 Far away from now; 
 (Now) can't you feel the pain inside 
 Your cage of sadness and rain " 
 "A one way train Turn into the past 
 The only choice - to escape - from now, 
 From tears - into the land of silence" 
 Again, again...
########### Total Void ###########
Switching on the lies, 
 Flickering the truth now dies. 
 Taking what they can, 
 Does not matter where we stand. 
 Listen to them, hear them say: 
 "Pay, then bad times go away!". 
 Don't believe, don't close your eyes! 
 Don't give another sacrifice. 
 Inside me shadows are veiling my mind. 
 (My) hope in the future will vanish behind 
 TOTAL VOID; CHIME IN HATE 
 Nothing new today, 
 Places change but pictures stay. 
 All signs point toward storm, 
 But still another lie is born. 
 Can't you see it, are you blind? 
 There's no good sense left to find. 
 Powers allocated wrong. 
 Men are weak and money's strong. 
 We're under "thoughts-control", 
 Don't see the pictures lie. 
 Open your mind to see what's going on
########### Until The End ###########
When I hear your whisper 
 (Then) my stomach turns into a heavy wall 
 My head is like an empty hole. 
 When I see you smiling 
 Flames of sadness burn me down. 
 (And) you can hear me cryin' 
 'Til the end of time. 
 'Trust in you and trust in me' 
 Just empty phrases falling -- down. 
 If I just could hate you. 
 If I just could make you cry like you have done 
 To me, so cold, so merciless. 
 I can't even find out 
 How to throw my thoughts away. 
 'Cause I just can't forget your face 
 When you turned away. 
 My mind is bleeding. Eternal fate. 
 Rain until the end of time 
 And no more reason to believe 
 In you and me - A killing tale. 
 Forever gone. It's over. 
 Waiting at my window. 
 Looking at myself to watch how thoughts can eat 
 A mindless soul away from you. 
 Not that I would miss you. 
 You're with me much more than all the time 
 Before you left me 
 And still your words are haunting me. 
 Too fast for me to comprehend - this fatal change
########### Not With Me ###########
You just don't like 
 You just can't stand 
 I guess you maybe 
 Just can't stand yourself 
 Don't need your well meant orders 
 Don't need your sweet control 
 Don't need your compromises 
 I don't need you to make 
 My mind up for me and to 
 Speak for me cause you 
 Can't even speak for yourself 
 Who do you think you are and who am I 
 To follow all your rules and why would I care 
 Not with me 
 Try to change me 
 Waste your time 
 Waste your whatever 
 As long as you're not wasting mine 
 I sure don't need nobody 
 To teach me right from wrong 
 And I sure do not need you 
 If you want me to 
 Change my own personality.
########### God's Funeral ###########
A rainy day 
 A silent procession 
 Dismayed faces 
 And empty stares 
 Beside the cross 
 A hole in the ground 
 The preacher tries to speak 
 But not a word comes out 
 And now down there he goes 
 He goes 
 No sense in praying 
 The bible - worthless 
 The one who led you dropped your strings 
 Now that he saw there's no day without sorrow 
 Your father threw his life away 
 You'll have to pray to a new god tomorrow 
 Think twice about your choice 
 Because there's no life to borrow 
 You will pay 
 The churches raped 
 The bibles burned 
 The sup_songs died away 
 A new one came 
 And you adore him 
 Just like before 
 You give him all you've got but still he calls for more 
 You see his powers grow 
 They grow 
 New holy houses 
 New sacred books 
 A new religion built of fear 
 Now that he saw he can live without sorrow 
 Your new father made you live to pay 
 You never know what he'll want from you tomorrow 
 And nobody cares for the tears that you swallow every day 
 Come to me my brother 
 I wash your conscience clean 
 I am the solution, the fulfilling of your dreams 
 Soak away your power 
 Eliminate your brain 
 All that will be left: A nameless servant for my game 
 Listen to my sermon 
 Your mind is where I dwell 
 Out there on the streets there are a million souls to sell 
 Fall into dependence 
 Too late now for distress 
 Pay for all your sins and make me rich while you confess 
 I promise you'll live in the sunshine 
 I promise your dreams will come true 
 It's all up to you
########### Nothing ###########
Cold has come to fill my heart 
 To numb my head and bones 
 Paralysed and torn apart 
 Thick and heavy feelings flow 
 Through my body turned to stone 
 Stiffened mind thoughts running slow 
 Dead man's image I can see 
 Had been killed so silently 
 Always been first to admit 
 But the very last to know 
 Didn't even know a bit 
 Couldn't see the foe 
 How could I have been so blind? 
 Says the man stabbed from behind 
 Every lie I had believed 
 Everything you misconceived 
 Every sign I didn't see 
 The mirror showing me 
 And what a long lying 
 What a wrong trying 
 And I knew I had to go 
 Like it was the only thing to know 
 And I know it was the only way 
 Not a single word left to say 
 So without a word I turned my back away 
 Silently I shut the door 
 To end the conflict stop the war 
 All that was it will be nothing 
 There is nothing left to say 
 Not a word not a single word to say 
 All that could have been it won't be 
 Here comes the final day 
 Nothing's like it was before 
 Just no connection anymore 
 And what a long dying 
 Such a wrong crying 
 And I knew I had to grow 
 Had to never let a weakness show 
 Had to push the memory far away 
 Had to try to find myself a better way 
 Every tear I didn't hide 
 A tiny little suicide 
 Every second by your side 
 A minute more of giving up my pride 
 Cold has filled my heart again 
 And turned my blood to stone 
 No sun so warm to warm you when 
 You're naked and alone 
 Pictures in my head again 
 That never will be shown 
 I'll return a stronger man 
 Stronger than the one you've known 
 All that was it will be nothing 
 There is nothing left to say 
 Not a word not a single word to say 
 Nothing there is nothing 
 Not a word no alert 
 You might change the way you dress 
 Change the color of your hair 
 You'll always change your mind I guess 
 Just like the clothes you wear 
 So if we ever meet again 
 A different time a different place 
 Don't forget I'll know by then 
 You will never change your ways 
 Nothing will be nothing 
 Not a word not a hurt 
 You might have to wear a coat 
 Weighing on you heavily 
 You might have to share the load 
 The load you put on me 
 There ain't no way now to disclaim 
 You'll always be the one to blame 
 So make a profit on the loss 
 Be a party take your share 
 Nail your conscience to the cross 
 To the cross you let me bear 
 Nothing will be nothing 
 Not a word to be heard 
 By the way I honestly 
 Thank you so much for teaching me 
 I've learned a lot you made me see 
 You are what I don't want to be

########### Stop ###########
Lost independence lost in dependence lost 
 Was a time of pleasure 
 Was a time of joy 
 Life so great and love so big and true 
 Seemed to be so easy 
 Seemed to be so clear 
 You belonged to me and me to you 
 And the days went slowly 
 But the days went by 
 Suddenly a change out of the blue 
 And I lost control 
 Playing a minor role 
 The play was tailor-made for you 
 Such a common story 
 Such a common tale 
 Circumstances change and feelings too 
 And your feelings changed 
 And you became estranged 
 I became a plaything in your hands 
 Captured in my distress 
 Longing for your caress 
 But I don't get what I demand 
 Stop hurting my pride 
 Playing games fucking up my mind 
 Stop doing me wrong 
 Can't you see I am not that strong 
 Say is it a thrill 
 Is it fun breaking up my will? 
 Who gave you the right 
 Who allowed you to take my light? 
 Now your time has come 
 Now your will is done 
 My will I had long since lost to you 
 Can't get away from you 
 Can't stop needing you 
 And there is nothing I can do 
 Stop hurting my pride 
 Playing games fucking up my mind 
 Stop playing with me 
 Satisfying your vanity 
 Say how do you dare 
 Treating somebody so unfair? 
 Stop taking my pride 
 I just can't stand this hell inside
########### Be Mine ###########
Such a beautiful feeling 
 Being by your side 
 On a summer evening 
 In the golden light 
 Of the sun that's leaving 
 And starts to hide 
 From a starry night 
 Hold me closely and make me stay 
 Lay your heart down next to me 
 All my worries are blown away 
 When I know you stand by me 
 All I've ever been longing for 
 Can be reached so easily 
 And so all I will ever be asking you for 
 Is to let your heart - let your heart be mine 
 Still a beautiful feeling 
 Being by your side 
 When the darkness is leaving 
 For the morning light 
 Comes shining bright 
 Hold me closely and make me stay 
 Share another day with me 
 All my troubles are washed away 
 When I know you're next to me 
 And so all I will ever be asking you for 
 Is to let your heart - Be mine 
 Hold me closely and make me stay 
 Tell me sweet things silently 
 Let me take your heart away 
 Say that you're a part of me 
 All my sorrows are far away 
 When you're holding on to me 
 All the obstacles in the way 
 Can be passed by easily 
 And so all I will ever be asking you for 
 Is to let your heart - let your heart be mine
########### Amok ###########
Sleepless I am walking through the lonely streets tonight 
 I can't await the sunset when the town becomes alive 
 My hell will be your hell you will pay me back with your pain 
 You'll have to face it soon 
 There's nothing you can do 
 The pain inside your heart 
 Will tear you apart 
 And now you have this path to follow 
 Turning your life around 
 You'll have a bitter pill to swallow 
 I'll bring you down 
 Now that I have shown you all the power in my hand 
 Your tears have quenched my thirst but what I can't understand: 
 There is no satisfaction just the need to hide away from you 
 I'll have to face it soon 
 There's nothing I can do 
 The guilt inside my heart 
 Will tear me apart 
 And now I have this path to follow 
 Turning my life around 
 I'll have a bitter pill to swallow 
 You'll bring me down

Rain 
 And storm replace the sun 
 As dark replaces light 
 My 
 Facade replaced my soul 
 As agony replaced my joy 
 But now I see 
 How time has veiled 
 The mirror to my mind 
 Ease replaced my self-esteem 
 As lethargy replaced my life 
 But now I feel 
 Time may have chained 
 My deepest point of view 
 Time 
 Will be on my side 
 Will be my guide 
 When I realize 
 Who I am 
 Free 
 Fallen frontiers 
 As narrowness fades 
 I will be there 
 To receive my amnesty 
 Into myself I'm falling 
 Entreating for a sign 
 Into myself I'm calling 
 The fears that take 
 - My sight 
 But now I know 
 I can unveil 
 The mirror of my mind 
 Time 
 Will heal me again 
 And I won't look back 
 'Cause I realize 
 Who I am

 No cage inside 
 No fence can hide

 Inside myself I'm crying 
 The tears that clean my sight 
 To find myself I'm leaving 
 The claw of mind-control 
 Inside my head it's calling: 
 'Be free'
########### This Promise ###########
You came into my life when I was drifting in a daze 
 And a sanctuary seemed to be so hard to find 
 A captive of my bitterness 
 Directed by my restlessness 
 Trying to stand aloof from things I couldn't leave behind 
 Just unable to express my fears 
 And still too sad to dry the tears 
 From a time I tried to get out of my mind 
 Then you took me by the hand 
 And soon you made me understand 
 That I had to look behind the clouds to see the sun 
 You gave my feelings time to grow 
 So patiently that I couldn't know 
 Our time would end before it even had begun 
 When I realized you'd go it made me see 
 How much you mean to me 
 I knew you had to go one day 
 And hoped you'd soon come back and stay 
 Because I surely know 
 It was way too good to let it go 
 I still trust in you 
 And I never thought 
 That you'd be gone forever 
 Yes I still believe 
 If we hold on to each other 
 And we don't loose faith 
 Then love will find a way 
 Take this promise 
 Take a promise from a wiser man 
 I would never 
 I would never let you go away again 
 From the bottom of my heart 
 I wish we had a second start 
 Now I surely know 
 I should have never let you go 
 Because deep inside of me there is a place 
 That you left an empty space 
 So don't you be afraid 
 If you don't know where to go to 
 There will always be 
 A place for you in me 
 Take this promise 
 Take a promise from a wiser man 
 I would never 
 I would never let you go 
 Take this promise 
 I've been missing you much more than words can say 
 And if you don't miss me 
 You should know that I will miss you anyway
########### Sweet Pretence (Bonus Track) ###########
Leave your mind to hear 
 Me proclaim that Eden's near 
 Follow my commands 
 They will save your soul 
 Your hell is your devotion 
 My pleasure's your demand 
 For big illusions 
 Your call for true pretence 
 Leave your mind to see 
 My sermon on the mount 
 Follow my doctrine 
 It heals you it heals me 
 Another town another tale 
 Another miracle for sale 
 Delirious you worship 
 When soon I start to preach 
 Business is calling me 
 My market value's high 
 Pay fast I have to leave 
 God bless you 
 Another town means another tale 
 Another miracle for sale 
 The rabble's quite delirious 
 My pleasure trip goes on and on 
 Blindness you want me to heal 
 But I can't heal the world 
 I never did I never will 
 I only deal in piece of mind

Here I am 
 To give you welfare 
 To bring you grace 
 You´re my seed 
 And you are my blood 
 You're sacred to me 
 Love you want 
 And peace you need - 
 This is not your way! 
 I don´t want 
 To smell tomorrow´s 
 Darkness again 
 (Pre-chorus:) 
 They are doomed in disaster 
 If you believe in me - 
 Now go, destroy their world for me 
 (Chorus:) 
 Wherever you go - I´m always around you 
 Whenever you cry - I´ll always be there 
 Whatever you fear - I´ll always protect you 
 Wherever you are - I´m always with you - 
 Rely on me! 
 You and I - 
 In perfect union 
 We´ll take their fight 
 I don´t care 
 If fate´s against me 
 As justice is mine 
 Don´t bind your hearts 
 With chains of beauty 
 When pleasure's pain 
 Time is hot 
 For revolution- 
 For victory! 
 (Pre-chorus:) 
 And still their demons 
 Try to surround us 
 And still they´re howling- 
 It´s time to spread the word of war! 
 And don´t bind your hearts with their chains of beauty 
 Because too much pleasure just causes you pain 
 Resisting their values means war against violence 
 And you are my army of wisdom and truth
########### Reflections ###########
Alone in the night I'm walking along the street. 
 The poise of my mind is drowned by the rain. 
 My hopes and my dreams, my visions are far away. 
 My angels of doom, I flee them in vain. 
 If I could repeat my life, Lord, I'd choose another way. 
 I'd decently spend my time, grateful workin' every day. 
 (Chorus) 
 Save me, heal me from madness 
 Please, guide your lost sheep. Show me the right way, rescue me 
 I've wasted so many years, they will never come again. 
 Took chances but won just tears. I was called a gambler then. 
 Hey boy, so don't you know, life's not fair so please stop crying. 
 Easy come easy go - those 4 words are your destiny. 
 Just drift that's your domain. 
 Aimless, drifting along. 
 Saves you, heals you forever, so never loose faith never ever again. 
 Alone in the night I'm drifting along the street. 
 The boat called "My mind" did not hit the ground. 
 My hopes and my dreams still haven't abandoned me. 
 Dear angels of doom, why don't you go down? 
 (Chorus) 
 Save me heal me from madness 
 Please guide your lost sheep. Show me the right way, rescue me! 
 Save me heal me from madness 
 Please guide your lost sheep. Show me the right way. 
 I'll never loose faith never ever again.
########### Breeze Of Insanity ###########
Right now, right here 
 I feel it clear 
 Rubicon is near and tempting 
 Scanning the crowd 
 You're standing out 
 Imagine we are kindred souls 
 Welcome my friend 
 Come, take my hand 
 Join me on my trip to heaven 
 Just you and I 
 Give it a try 
 And play the game of games 
 Maybe you know, people sleep away 
 Can´t see the foe, the sin to rule their day 
 So, if you know how to wash their brain 
 Then you should go and cleanse it of its pain - do it just for gain. 
 Just look around 
 Aren´t they all bound 
 By the curse of mindless urges 
 Sex, love and hate 
 Determine their fate 
 And jealousy, the self-made grief 
 Emotional mess 
 Poor mawkishness 
 Feelings are the scourge of mankind 
 Kerry, my dear 
 Let´s scream out of here 
 Time to heal the world. 
 Maybe you know, we are born that way 
 Can´t see the foe, the sin to rule our day 
 So, if you know how to wash their brain 
 Then you should go and cleanse it of its pain - do it just for gain 
 Feelings make you helpless 
 Feelings cause you pain - Be free! 
 For the love of gain

I came to you 
 To save your souls 
 To reveal to you- 
 Truth of fear and pain 
 And maybe tonight 
 Release will come to you 
 I am the one 
 Who'll take the load 
 Away from your bones 
 And I proclaim now: 
 (Chorus:) 
 Never fear your lives again 
 Cause I always will be 
 With you - now and eternally 
 Don´t you dare to hesitate - 
 We´ll defy this world! 
 I am your will 
 So come with me 
 And don´t waste your passion 
 Don´t waste energy! 
 What brings you pain 
 Is unrequited love 
 (So) focus (your) dreams on me - 
 Then I will bless you! 
 (Chorus:) 
 Never fear your lives again 
 Cause I always will be 
 With you now and eternally 
 Don´t you dare to hesitate 
 We´ll defy this world 
 You won´t try to find the answer 
 When there is no single question left 
 Never let your soul be wounded 
 Don´t you give no mercy to your fear 
 You don´t hate if you don´t suffer 
 You don´t cry if you don´t love no more 
 You won´t starve 'cause hate´s just poisoned love 
 And this is all my lesson, 
 My compassion, my word - my doctrine
########### My Fate ###########
Nothing's real, 
 All around me died. 
 And I feel 
 All I've tried to leave behind 
 How can you dare 
 Binding me with your stare 
 And now silently 
 Screaming I'm 
 Losing 
 My mind. 
 Will you break 
 All the chains 'round my heart 
 'N set me free, 
 Let me find another start 
 Are you my fate? 
 Can you open the gate, 
 Straight to Eden 
 To keep me 
 Forever alive. 
 But I know 
 (I) have to leave you tomorrow 
 All the feelings we share are in vain 
 And our tears will flow like rain 
 But I know 
 I'll still love you tomorrow 
 And until the end of days 
 'Til I die. 
 Come with me, 
 Let us share this precious night. 
 Want to be 
 For a lifetime at your side. 
 Show me the way. 
 Chase the dark clouds away 
 Feel the magic 
 Around us, 
 And let us be free 
 'Cause I know 
 (I) have to leave you tomorrow 
 All the feelings we share are in vain 
 And our tears will flow like rain 
 But I know 
 I'll still love you tomorrow 
 And I'll have to hide the scars 
 In my soul
########### Reach For Reign ###########
Exciting news 
 We´re talk of the town, my friend 
 It seems like the seed is beginning to grow 
 Can´t get it yet 
 They all start to spread the word 
 We have to make sure we keep hold of the steer 
 (Bridge:) 
 If we make it right, we can unhinge the world 
 All the fools will pay us devotion 
 Now, we must jump at the chance 
 Silently press the button, turn the key 
 (Chorus:) 
 Reach for reign! Now it is in sight 
 Soon, I know, we will have a ball, collect more souls 
 Reach for reign! Now the time has come 
 Who will dare keep the chosen back? We take the world! 
 Showtime is near 
 I´m ready to spread the word 
 And messing around with those blockheads is fun 
 Soon on TV 
 Presenting the new Messiah 
 The credulous masses will get a great show
########### The Unwanted ###########
Welcome tonight 
 This is my show 
 Tell me your questions and I'll let you know 
 Spotlight is set 
 Right to my place 
 So everyone in the world sees my face 
 I am prepared 
 To spread my will, 
 To give the people out there a new thrill 
 You ask me how 
 I dare to call 
 Myself the godlike redeemer for all 
 Is it pretence? 
 A big pack of lies? 
 The wolf in sheep's clothing, appearing too nice? 
 Frankly I am 
 Only a tool 
 Fixing diseases of people like you 
 Are you afraid 
 Of my visions, 
 That I give them a reason for change? 
 Do you feel 
 Lost and shaky? 
 Don't you know 
 (Chorus:) 
 I´m the unwanted 
 I´m your fear 
 Don´t deny it! 
 I am a thorn 
 In rotten flesh 
 Of rotten values
########### Fallen ###########
Still feel you near 
 When your eyes are stabbin' me 
 No need to read the signs- 
 Won´t foresee who I am 
 I made my choice 
 Officially now love is dead and gone 
 And threatening shadows dancin' 
 To guide me my way 
 One more time 
 We meet grace to die 
 Tonight we leave 
 And a million mysteries unfold 
 Their wings to demon skies 
 -When I´m down- 
 To announce I´m fallen 
 Million mysteries unleash 
 Their blackness in my head- 
 And I´m down - and I´m down... 
 Won´t sail with you 
 On a dream now sunken deep away 
 Eternal flames of magic 
 Were frozen in their past 
 I lift my gaze 
 To a moving sky above me 
 And there I face my angels 
 Of doom once again 
 One more time 
 We meet grace to die 
 Tonight we end 
 (Eden-Ref:) 
 And right now your are here 
 And now you are down to follow 
 'Cause it's me 
 Who came down to take your ease, 
 (To) steal the beauty of your heart 
 Now I´m here 
 And I´m down to follow you 
 Right through heaven into hell- 
 Stole your love to kill myself 
 And I´m down 
 Now I´m down 
 (Fisher:) 
 "You and I- 
 A tale far behind us 
 The heaviest cross 
 I've ever made" 
 (Eden:) 
 "Here you sit 
 You're breakin´me slowly 
 To dance on a thin line 
 Along the ocean of your soul" 
 You're inside, 
 Forever on my mind- 
 No reason to forsake you here, 
 To end before we start 
 But I will close my heart 
 My angels call again 
 And real is different don't you know, 
 No place for love - 
 No chance for you and I 
 (Eden:) 
 You're inside, 
 You're on my mind 
 Without end 
 But I won't... 
 Just let them call 
 And I know the place where love is real 
 Turn away 
 Can't you stay 
 Don´t you see 
 I'm not free 
 I´m not free 
 Life is chaining me 
 Love is chaining me 
 Leave my life 
 How can I leave 
 Don´t come back 
 I'll never 
 Fly away 
 Not to fall down with me 
 Cause you fall down with me
########### Terror Fantasy ###########
I feel like I am falling 
 Down a waterfall of pain. 
 And all the useless feelings 
 They are coming back to me again. 
 My life became so easy. 
 I've been bathing in success. 
 But now these days are over, 
 And I'm living deep inside in a mess. 
 But I'll teach you 
 What it means to 
 Dare to question 
 All that I do. 
 I am stronger, 
 I've the power 
 To destroy your will, 
 To make you believe cause you're 
 (Chorus:) 
 Blinded by your fantasy 
 That's building a wall between you and me. 
 You don't know what's good for you, 
 So listen to me, what I say! 
 All the creepy things I'm hiding 
 Are the mirrors of my grief. 
 But to you I'm always shining 
 'Cause I want you to believe in me 
 So come to me and listen 
 To my sermon while you stay. 
 You will never lead, you follow! 
 And still it is me to whom you pray! 
 Cause I'll teach you 
 What it means to 
 Keep belief in 
 All that I do 
 You'll be stronger 
 You've the power 
 To spread all my will 
 To tell all the fools that they're 
 (Chorus:) 
 Blinded by their fantasy 
 That's buildin´ a wall between them and me 
 You will save their darkened souls 
 If you go and tell them what's right my friend. 
 Blinded are their foolish minds 
 So tell them there is something else to find 
 Never leave the path I show 
 Cause I will find you and you'll pay for the rest of your life. 
 Can you teach me 
 What it means to 
 Live in peace and 
 Do things you do. 
 All the feelings 
 I have to hide 
 Sting my broken heart. 
 But the torture 
 Gives me power 
 To go further 
 To be with you 
 And then my pain 
 Will be your pain, 
 Will be your distress 
 Then your life's a mess 
 And I will tell you that you're 
 (Chorus:) 
 Blinded by your fantasy 
 That's building a wall between you and me. 
 You don't know what's good for you, 
 So listen to me, what I say my friend. 
 Blinded are your foolish minds 
 I tell you there is something else to find! 
 Never leave the path I show 
 Cause I will find you and then you will pay! 
 And your pain 
 Is my gain 
 And my dream 
 Makes you scream 
 And my way 
 Is your way, 
 Is what rules your life my friend.
########### Broken World ###########
How could I have been so blind 
 I had no doubts, standing at his side 
 Seems I woke up from a dream, 
 Opened my eyes; with a vengeance I scream 
 Out the feelings I left behind. 
 (Chorus) 
 Here I stand 
 Nothing in my hands 
 World just broke apart 
 Divided by my heart. 
 He's the master, playing god 
 And he's the leader, without failure but 
 I can't stand this anymore, 
 Have to leave him, have to stop this before 
 All the madness is killing me 
 (Chorus) 
 Here I stand, 
 (With) Nothing in my hands, 
 (My) world just broke apart 
 Divided by my heart. 
 Now I flee 
 Everyone I see 
 Noone left to trust 
 Have to leave the past behind me 
 I have to stop him, I have to find a way out. 
 Nobody's with me, how can I make it alone, to survive, 
 And when no one believes me that he's insane.
########### U R Resistence ###########
We all meet here today 
 Cause we have to make new plans. 
 And what pushed us so far 
 Leads us into defense now 
 And if we look at our lives - 
 We just became tools of our leader. 
 And if we see what we've done - 
 Then we mixed up freedom with madness 
 Hear me 
 Call for resistance 
 Our time has come and 
 See me 
 Cry for deliverance 
 We have to stop this... 
 As we followed his will 
 We were blinded by gainings 
 No more love, no more joy, 
 It's like living in vain now. 
 Now we must stop the disease! 
 I know we can make it together. 
 We have the power my friends 
 Cause we are the last hope for freedom 
 Hear me 
 Call for resistance 
 This is our last chance 
 See me 
 Cry for deliverance 
 It's not too late so 
 (Chorus:) 
 Wake up now 
 Wake up here 
 Show your pain 
 Show your resistance 
 You're not blind! 
 See what's real! 
 Leave him now! 
 He is no god for you! 
 (Conversation:) 
 (Person 1:) 
 I understand, but what can we do? His influence is growing day by day! 
 (Person 2:) 
 It's dangerous to think differently than him! We have to consider that! 
 (Person 3:) 
 Whatever we do, we will attract his wrath. 
 (Person 4:) 
 I don't know how we could stop him. What should we do?! 
 (Kerioth:) 
 There is only one way. KILL HIM! 
 Not willing to die in my sorrow- 
 I will not live in vain 
 It´s more than a gate for tomorrow 
 It is our last chance 
 (Chorus:) 
 Wake up now 
 Wake up here 
 Show you're strong 
 Show your resistance 
 You're not blind! 
 See what's on! 
 Leave him now! 
 He is no god for you! 
 There will be no god, all might comes from you!
########### Judgement Day ###########
There's no way back, I'm going in. 
 Cold sweat running down my skin 
 Never felt like this before 
 But I am right, I have to kill the core. 
 I feel the cold steel in my hand 
 The sight is free from where I stand 
 Funny just how things can change. 
 From god to foe, come on let's rearrange. 
 (Chorus) 
 Time to die 
 Now your life's gone by. 
 Free our souls 
 Give back all you stole. 
 (Fisher:) 
 My mission is fulfilled 
 I'll die, but be living still. 
 I'll live eternally 
 (Chorus) 
 Time to die 
 Now your life's gone by. 
 Free our souls 
 Give back all you stole. 
 Die for me 
 Sleep eternally 
 Free our souls 
 Give back all you stole.

 Says, "Make the most of never-never 
 Horizon starts right here 
 The future's always near" 
 And I 
 I know this time is borrowed 
 I try to remember and forget my sorrow

 I'll leave before my fear's confirmed

 These four walls are lost forever 
 I could never be that clever 
 Celluloid, monochrome or color 
 Don't want to end in tears 
 There's nothing left to discover 
 Did I learn to walk too soon? 
 Is there time to turn the screw? 
 Survive destiny, Polaroid me 
 What's left to say about yesterday? 
 I'll leave before my fear's confirmed 
 Scared to love 
 Wasted knowledge 
 Gift to the grave 
 These four walls are lost forever 
 I could never be that clever
########### Sweet Pretence ###########
Leave your mind to hear 
 Me proclaim that Eden's near 
 Follow my commands 
 They will save your soul 
 Your hell is your devotion 
 My pleasure's your demand 
 For big illusions 
 Your call for true pretence 
 Leave your mind to see 
 My sermon on the mount 
 Follow my doctrine 
 It heals you it heals me 
 Another town another tale 
 Another miracle for sale 
 Delirious you worship 
 When soon I start to preach 
 Business is calling me 
 My market value's high 
 Pay fast I have to leave 
 God bless you 
 Another town means another tale 
 Another miracle for sale 
 The rabble's quite delirious 
 My pleasure trip goes on and on 
 Blindness you want me to heal 
 But I can't heal the world 
 I never did I never will 
 I only deal in piece of mind

########### Woke Up In Love ###########
Somewhere in the night 
 Fell in love with you 
 Wandered through my dreams 
 And you stole away my blues 
 All of a sudden a random feeling 
 Opened up inside 
 And I don't know where jump through the 
 Or make my darling cry 
 Woke up in love with you 
 Oh, what a beautiful day 
 Am I still dreaming 
 Is it supposed to feel this way 
 Running around with a foolish grin 
 Painted all over my face 
 Woke up in love with you 
 Oh, what a beautiful day 
 Used to run around 
 In no particular direction 
 I ran across a lot of pretty women 
 But I couldn't make a connection 
 Light night when you held me tight 
 You turned my life around 
 And I opened up my eyes this morning 
 Said, "look what I found" 
 Woke up in love with you 
 Oh, what a beautiful day 
 Am I still dreaming 
 Is it supposed to feel this way 
 Running around with a foolish grin 
 Painted all over my face 
 Woke up in love with you 
 Oh, what a beautiful day 
 Woke up in love with you 
 Oh, what a beautiful day 
 Am I still dreaming 
 Is it supposed to feel this way 
 Running around with a foolish grin 
 Painted all over my face 
 Woke up in love with you 
 Oh, what a beautiful day 
 Woke up in love with you 
 Oh, what a beautiful day 
 Am I still dreaming 
 Is it supposed to feel this way 
 Running around with a foolish grin 
 Painted all over my face 
 Woke up in love with you 
 Oh, what a beautiful day
########### I Don't Want To Be A Memory ###########
I don't want to be a memory 
 Just a shadow in your mind 
 Wanna be the one you always need 
 Not the one you left behind 
 I don't want to be a notch in your handle 
 Another love casualty 
 So lay back down and let's talk it over 
 'Cause I don't want to be a memory 
 Don't you remember how it used to be 
 When we were so in love 
 We spent the nights in a two-room flat 
 Drinking wine from a coffee cup 
 Making love was so very easy 
 We couldn't get enough 
 I never dreamed there would come a time 
 When you'd think about giving me up 
 I don't want to be a memory 
 Just a shadow in your mind 
 I wanna be the one you always need 
 Not the one you left behind 
 I don't want to be a notch in your handle 
 Another love casualty 
 So lay back down and let's talk it over 
 'Cause I don't want to be a memory 
 I know you've had other lovers 
 But that's all history 
 I got to know that you'll let me be the last one 
 To share your company 
 I don't want to be a memory 
 Just a shadow in your mind 
 I wanna be the one you always need 
 Not the one you left behind 
 I don't want to be a notch in your handle 
 Another love casualty 
 So lay back down and let's talk it over 
 'Cause I don't want to be 
 I don't want to be a memory 
 Just a shadow in your mind 
 I wanna be the one you always need 
 Not the one you left behind 
 I don't want to be a memory
########### She's A Miracle ###########
I don't need a shooting star 
 To make my wish come true 
 I don't need a four-leaf clover 
 Or a crystal ball to see through 
 Don't need a claim to fame 
 Like some folks always do 
 Got my very own big-time star 
 And she shines the whole night through 
 She's a miracle, a sight to see 
 Oh, the way she touches me 
 Way down deep in my soul 
 Something's got a hold and it won't let go 
 If I stumble, and if I fall 
 She's waiting right there to catch me, oh 
 She's a miracle, a miracle to me 
 I don't need any good-luck charms 
 Always hanging around 
 Don't need any wishing well 
 To throw my money down 
 Don't need to make the front-page news 
 Be the talk of the town 
 I'm telling all the world, I've got a heavenly girl 
 Right here on the ground 
 She's a miracle, a sight to see 
 Oh, the way she touches me 
 Way down deep in my soul 
 Something's got a hold and it won't let go 
 If I stumble, and if I fall 
 She's waiting right there to catch me, oh 
 She's a miracle, a miracle to me 
 She's everything in the world to me 
 A beautiful dream come true 
 Every day I count my blessings 
 'Cause I'm the lucky one she gives her loving to 
 Oh, she's a miracle, a sight to see 
 Oh, the way she touches me 
 Way down deep in my soul 
 Something's got a hold and it won't let go 
 If I stumble, and if I fall 
 She's waiting right there to catch me, oh

 Oh, the way she touches me 
 Way down deep in my soul 
 Something's got a hold and it won't let go...

########### I Could Get Used To You ###########
Girl, you know it wouldn't take much 
 Just one little bitty touch from you 
 You could make me feel so fine 
 If you're so inclined to 
 If you feel like dancing 
 Let it show 
 Tell me anything 
 But please don't say no 
 I could get used to you 
 Oh, darling, you're so fine 
 I could grow accustomed to 
 Your body layin' right next to mine 
 If you would walk on my way 
 Girl, I'd give my heart away to you 
 Dancing all through the night 
 Holding each other tight 
 Darling that's what I'd like to do with you babe

########### Hang On To Your Heart ###########
The band was playing, kinda, something low 
 All the lovers swaying, to and fro 
 You and me, together, dancing real slow 
 Tonight's the night, I want you to know 
 I can't hold out any longer 
 Remember, love can't grow 
 Oh, very much stronger 
 You better hang on to your heart, hold on tight 
 Or I'm gonna steal it away, tonight 
 I'll take you in my arms and never ever let you go 
 There's a new moon out, the stars are shining bright 
 You're here with me and it feels so right 
 So hang on to your heart 
 Or I'm gonna steal it away 
 You're living proof, that dreams come true 
 I can't believe, I'm really holding you 
 So close, so tight, all night through 
 If I could only make time stand still, forever 
 It'll always be 
 Just you and me 
 Here, together 
 You better hang on to your heart, hold on tight 
 Or I'm gonna steal it away, tonight 
 I'll take you in my arms and never ever let you go 
 There's a new moon out, the stars are shining bright 
 You're here with me and it feels so right 
 So hang on to your heart

########### I Got Love (Super-Duper Love) ###########
Baby, I'm off the wall 
 Up the creek 
 Goin' down the wrong way 
 On a one-way street 
 I ain't got the sense 
 That the good Lord gave a goose 
 But I sure got one thing 
 That I'd like to give to you 
 I got love, super love 
 Super duper love for you 
 I ain't no doctor, ain't got no PhD 
 When you talk about love 
 You better talk to me 
 I got love, super duper love 
 I ain't too good lookin', 
 Won't be no movie king 
 Won't be no Elvis 
 Up on the silver screen 
 Can't be no teacher 
 No nuclear scientist 
 If you ain't been kissed by me, baby 
 You ain't been kissed 
 I got love, super love 
 Super duper love for you 
 I ain't no doctor, ain't got no PhD 
 When you talk about love 
 You better talk to me

########### She's Too Good To Be True ###########
It's gettin' late 
 The day's at it's end 
 My favorite time is right around the bend 
 It's when the time comes to turn the lights down low 
 She Pours the wine and I lock the door 
 She takes my hand like so many nights before 
 That's when I know 
 Heaven's waiting for me 
 She's too good to be true 
 She blows my mind 
 She's still the one who thrills me time after time 
 It's unbelievable 
 The way she moves me 
 She's so easy to love 
 So tender to hold 
 She touches me like no one I've ever known 
 The way she moves me 
 She's too good to be true 
 The radio plays a melody 
 One designed especially for her and me 
 An ol' love song that we used to slow dance to 
 And when she says how happy she's been 
 That old familiar feeling comes over me again 
 I count my blessings how lucky I am 
 She's too good to be true 
 She blows my mind 
 She's still the one who thrills me time after time 
 It's unbelievable 
 The way she moves me 
 She's so easy to love 
 So tender to hold 
 She touches me like no one I've ever known 
 The way she moves me 
 She's too good to be true 
 The way she moves me 
 She's too good to be true
########### I Can't Get Close Enough ###########
Anything, I would give anything 
 If I could only show you 
 How strong my passion is for you 
 But every time I've tried to tell you 
 I can't find the right words to say 
 No matter how hard I keep trying 
 I just haven't found a way 
 I can't get close enough, I can't get close enough to you 
 Just holding you tight, all night, doesn't seem to do 
 I can't get near enough, I can't get near enough of you 
 But you know that, it's a good kind of thing I'm going through 
 Everywhere, I would go everywhere 
 Right beside you, if that would prove my love for you 
 Wherever you lead, I would follow, it makes no difference, you see 
 I'd give anything to make you understand how much you mean to me 
 I can't get close enough, I can't get close enough to you 
 Just holding you tight, all night, doesn't seem to do 
 I can't get near enough, I can't get near enough of you 
 But you know that, it's a good kind of thing I'm going through 
 Oh, I can't get close enough, I can't get close enough to you 
 Just holding you tight, all night, doesn't seem to do 
 I can't get near enough, I can't get near enough of you 
 But you know that, it's a good kind of thing I'm going through 
 But you know that, it's a good kind of thing I'm going through 
 Got to get closer, near enough, near enough for you

########### It's You Again ###########
It's you again 
 Walkin' through my mind again 
 In my dreams it never ends 
 It's always you again 
 They say all good things must come to an end 
 Nothin's forever, so they say 
 But it looks like they left one question unanswered 
 How can you go and yet still remain? 
 It's you again 
 Walkin' through my mind again 
 Takin' all my time again 
 You just won't let go 
 It's you again 
 Always you I'm seein' 
 In my dreams it never ends 
 It's always you again 
 Time after time, I've tried somebody new 
 Still there's this emptiness inside 
 I can't find a way to get over losing you 
 My heart won't let go those memories you left behind 
 It's you again 
 Walkin' through my mind again 
 Takin' all my time again 
 You just won't let go

 Always you I'm seein' 
 In my dreams it never ends 
 It's always you again 
 It's you again

########### The Invisible Man ###########
I could leave this job and never be missed 
 Every day I get to feel like this 
 The only time I ever hear my name 
 Is when somebody needs someone to blame 
 I think I'm the invisible man, I never know where I stand 
 People walking up to me lookin' right through me 
 Talking to the beat of the band, yeah I wonder what to do sometimes 
 I'm startin' to think that I'm the invisible man 
 Well my girlfriend's good friends they don't see 
 What my girlfriends sees in me 
 Yeah they're lookin' at me like I'm not there 
 And they tell her that I ain't goin' nowhere 
 Like I'm the invisible man I never know where I stand 
 People walking up to me lookin' right through me 
 Talking to the beat of the band, yeah I wonder what to do sometimes 
 I'm startin' to think that I'm the invisible man 
 You can't see 
 You can't see me 
 it ain't because I'm Santa Claus 
 It's because I'm the invisible man I never know where I stand 
 People walking up to me lookin' right through me 
 Talkin' to the beat of the band, yeah I wonder what to do sometimes 
 I'm startin' to think that I'm the invisible man 
 I'm the invisible man 
 I'm invisible 
 I'm the invisible man
########### Heart And Soul ###########
Four o'clock this morning 
 If she should come a-calling 
 I wouldn't dream of turning her away 
 And if it got hot and hectic 
 I know she'd be electric 
 I'd let her take her chances with me 
 You see, she gets what she wants 
 'Cause she's heart and soul 
 She's hot and cold 
 She's got it all, hot loving in the night 
 Woah 
 Woah 
 Well, can't you see her standing there 
 See how she looks, see how she cares 
 I let her steal the night away from me 
 Five o'clock this morning 
 She left without a warning 
 I let her take advantage of me 
 You see, she got what she wanted 
 'Cause she's heart and soul 
 She's hot and cold 
 She's got it all, hot loving every night 
 Woah 
 Woah 
 Yeah, she's heart and soul 
 She's hot and cold 
 She's got it all 
 She's heart and soul 
 She's heart and soul 
 She's heart and soul 
 She's heart and soul 
 Four o'clock this morning 
 If she should come a-calling 
 I wouldn't dream of turning her away 
 Five o'clock this morning 
 She left without a warning

########### Erosion Of Thought ###########
This earth is tense, its waiting for lift off 
 The atmosphere seems to swallow me whole 
 I can see nothing without the clouds 
 Its the opposite of reason, its impossible 
 The sea will become shallow, too shallow to be seen 
 The sun blinds my reason 
 The light is complacent 
 My will be unknown 
 To be seen in tongues, is it real? 
 The following is past, present, and future 
 But part of me isn't here 
 What is all of this? 
 A burden of hope or a collapse of thought 
 Simple words signify degradation 
 The passion within is flames 
 Time means nothing 
 Winter barren 
 Spring brings anew 
 Rest assured 
 Times means nothing 
 Strength comes from weakness 
 Winter barren 
 Spring brings anew 
 This doesn't change anything at all 
 To be seen in tongues, is it real? 
 The following is past, present, and future 
 Rain degrades the sand 
 Until the remains are unclear 
 Floods of anxiety flow through me 
 Rain degrades the sand 
 Floods of anxiety 
 Rain degrades the sand 
 Rest assured 
 Rain degrades the sand 
 Strength comes from weakness 
 Rain degrades the sand 
 Past, present, and future 
 Rain degrades the sand 
 The passion within is flames
########### Nullity ###########
Protection, reflection, and guidance 
 Embrace the findings 
 In the end, all will fit in harmony 
 The joy of unknown sources 
 Where do I begin? 
 A path where... 
 Anticipate happiness 
 Where do I begin? 
 Think to what means most 
 Where does it all come from? 
 Look no further than the heart 
 No shame to be trusted 
 Everything is linked 
 From one to none 
 Possible fades to impossibility 
 Does it all make sense? 
 Fall again 
 Into pieces 
 Oblivion affects us all 
 Sunset settles sailors as the sky is brightly ending 
 This is only one sign of the beauty of what I know 
 Gripping my last breath upon the ledge 
 Of redemption and resignation 
 The choice is only a heartbeat away 
 I can see for miles 
 Does distance attract a voice of reason? 
 I can see for miles 
 The gut feeling of pure energy 
 Undying soliloquies are constant in my mind 
 Particularity phrases precious thoughts 
 To take miles for granted with the breath of eternal passion 
 Fall 
 Into pieces 
 Fall again 
 Fall 
 Into pieces
########### Persistance Constant ###########
Regardless of anything that has happened 
 Perseverance will prevail 
 I've been pushed to the edge 
 Its only a glimer of hope to think of the possibilities 
 Reclaiming what is mine 
 I see how people survive 
 I don't see why I can't push as hard sometimes 
 I look forward anyways 
 What doesn't kill makes a whole lot stronger 
 Reclamation by perseverence 
 Pushing on 
 No matter what comes 
 I will conquer all 
 Setting my sites on the goal 
 Is the only thing that can possibly protect me 
 From my own selfish interests 
 The only thing in life to look forward to 
 Is the final goal 
 Is the final goal 
 Sites are set 
 Moving on and forward 
 I will push back the mountains 
 Sites are set 
 Moving on 
 Our sites are set 
 Brush up against death 
 Its not what you think it is 
 I promise you have a chance 
 Looking into eternity 
 I choose my own fate 
 I have someone looking over my back 
 I will never look back 
 Anything can get in my way 
 But nothing will move me 
 Anything can get in my way 
 Nothing will move me 
 Reclamation by perseverence 
 Pushing on 
 No matter what comes in my way 
 I, I will conquer all 
 I will conquer all
########### Placidity ###########
Human emotion seems to affect us all 
 Nothing can come from nothing 
 Relaxation is the key to tranquility 
 Atmospheric changes tip toe upon stability 
 Atmospheric changes tip toe 
 Placidity 
 Calm, quiet waters 
 Pour over me 
 The time is now 
 Take me away from this placidity 
 I will make my stand pressured 
 Why is being like this so hastily hated 
 Push yourself to the test 
 Where am i in literal terms to you 
 I am an individual 
 I get whats needed 
 Push yourself to the test 
 Take away from my frustration 
 I may be alone 
 But tranquility lasts forever 
 Pull yourself to the ground 
 Watch me sit back and smile 
 Placidity is what brings me peace 
 What do you bring to the world? 
 Placidity 
 I will overcome the past 
 I set my sights for the future 
 I will try my best for thats all I can do 
 Put my sights on the prize 
 Placidity 
 A proper sendoff is what we deserve 
 A long time goodbye with peace and deliverance
########### Amalgation ###########
Pressure the hinges 
 Watch us fall apart 
 Walls will crumble 
 Everything comes down 
 Rectify a new machine 
 To create what was impossible 
 Achieving creation 
 Success brings pride 
 Through creation is change 
 Hunger for more is predictable 
 Pressure the hinges 
 Watch it fall apart 
 Pressure the hinges 
 Fall apart 
 The machine will fall 
 Creation failed 
 Amalgamation 
 What has happened 
 Amalgamation 
 What has happened to us 
 Man plays God 
 Man fails 
 Man plays God 
 Man will fail
########### Pathways ###########
Innovation only comes when the time is near 
 Your state of mind determines it's meaning 
 Half-hearted action leaves empty trails 
 There is only one way to truth 
 Textures become faded memories 
 As days grow into aeon 
 Inclination to nostalgia 
 Nights emerge into rareform 
 Pathways are laid before me 
 Which one do I choose 
 Logical security 
 Becomes solidarity 
 Trails will be left behind me 
 What tale will they tell 
 Each day grows closer 
 And each day grows dimmer 
 Two headed monster 
 Only one will win 
 Choices become change 
 Vitality 
 Revision sets in 
 Innovation 
 We set the standards 
 We are in charge of who we will become
